postgresql-9.3 (9.3~rc1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream release: first 9.3 release candidate.
    - Add locking around SSL_context usage in libpq, to make it thread safe.
      (Closes: #718460)
  * debian/rules: Support multi-arch locations of {tcl,tk}-config.
  * debian/rules: Don't build with kerberos and LDAP support for
    DEB_STAGE=stage1 to aid with bootstrapping.
  * debian/tests/control: Add missing net-tools dependency (for ifconfig).
  * debian/rules: Call dh with --parallel.
  * debian/control: Explicitly Conflicts/Replaces postgresql-9.1-dbg, as that
    did not yet have a "Provides: postgresql-dbg". (Closes: #717982)

  [ Christoph Berg ]
  * Pull 6697aa2bc25c83b88d6165340348a31328c35de6 from upstream head to
    better support VPATH builds of PGXS modules.
  * debian/rules: Call make check-world without -k and use a random port
    number for pg_regress.

postgresql-9.3 (9.3~beta2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/postgresql-9.3.preinst: Abort upgrade if there are still clusters
    with the 9.3beta1 format, these need to be dumped/dropped first.
    (Closes: #714328)

postgresql-9.3 (9.3~beta2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Christoph Berg ]
  * hurd-i386: Ignore testsuite failures so we have a working libpq5 (they
    don't implement semaphores so the server won't even start).
  * Mark postgresql-9.3 as beta in the description, suggested by Joshua D.
    Drake.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream release 9.3 beta2.

postgresql-9.3 (9.3~beta1-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * sparc, alpha: Remove -O1 - we have been using this since 2007, but now it
    looks the other way round, "make check" fails on sparc with -O1, but works
    with -O2.
  * kfreebsd-*: Ignore testsuite failures until we resolve the plperl
    failures, see #704802.

postgresql-9.3 (9.3~beta1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Update watch file for 9.3.
  * 64-pg_upgrade-sockdir: If cwd is too long to use as socketdir in
    pg_upgrade, fall back to /tmp. (A Unix socket path must not be longer than
    107 chars.)
