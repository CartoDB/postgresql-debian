  * New upstream bug fix release.
     * Improve page-splitting decisions in GiST indexes (Alexander
       Korotkov, Robert Haas, Tom Lane)
       Multi-column GiST indexes might suffer unexpected bloat due to this
       error.
     * Fix cascading privilege revoke to stop if privileges are still held
       (Tom Lane)
       If we revoke a grant option from some role "X", but "X" still holds
       that option via a grant from someone else, we should not
       recursively revoke the corresponding privilege from role(s) "Y"
       that "X" had granted it to.
     * Fix handling of SIGFPE when PL/Perl is in use (Andres Freund)
       Perl resets the process's SIGFPE handler to SIG_IGN, which could
       result in crashes later on. Restore the normal Postgres signal
       handler after initializing PL/Perl.
     * Prevent PL/Perl from crashing if a recursive PL/Perl function is
       redefined while being executed (Tom Lane)
     * Work around possible misoptimization in PL/Perl (Tom Lane)
       Some Linux distributions contain an incorrect version of
       "pthread.h" that results in incorrect compiled code in PL/Perl,
       leading to crashes if a PL/Perl function calls another one that
       throws an error.

postgresql-8.3 (8.3.20-1.pgapt+1) sid-pgapt; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release.
     * Prevent access to external files/URLs via XML entity references
       (Noah Misch, Tom Lane)
       xml_parse() would attempt to fetch external files or URLs as needed
       to resolve DTD and entity references in an XML value, thus allowing
       unprivileged database users to attempt to fetch data with the
       privileges of the database server. While the external data wouldn't
       get returned directly to the user, portions of it could be exposed
       in error messages if the data didn't parse as valid XML; and in any
       case the mere ability to check existence of a file might be useful
       to an attacker. (CVE-2012-3489)
     * Prevent access to external files/URLs via "contrib/xml2"'s
       xslt_process() (Peter Eisentraut)
       libxslt offers the ability to read and write both files and URLs
       through stylesheet commands, thus allowing unprivileged database
       users to both read and write data with the privileges of the
       database server. Disable that through proper use of libxslt's
       security options. (CVE-2012-3488)
       Also, remove xslt_process()'s ability to fetch documents and
       stylesheets from external files/URLs. While this was a documented
       "feature", it was long regarded as a bad idea. The fix for
       CVE-2012-3489 broke that capability, and rather than expend effort
       on trying to fix it, we're just going to summarily remove it.
     * Prevent too-early recycling of btree index pages (Noah Misch)
       When we allowed read-only transactions to skip assigning XIDs, we
       introduced the possibility that a deleted btree page could be
       recycled while a read-only transaction was still in flight to it.
       This would result in incorrect index search results. The
       probability of such an error occurring in the field seems very low
       because of the timing requirements, but nonetheless it should be
       fixed.
     * Fix crash-safety bug with newly-created-or-reset sequences (Tom
       Lane)
       If "ALTER SEQUENCE" was executed on a freshly created or reset
       sequence, and then precisely one nextval() call was made on it, and
       then the server crashed, WAL replay would restore the sequence to a
       state in which it appeared that no nextval() had been done, thus
       allowing the first sequence value to be returned again by the next
       nextval() call. In particular this could manifest for serial
       columns, since creation of a serial column's sequence includes an
       "ALTER SEQUENCE OWNED BY" step.
     * Ensure the "backup_label" file is fsync'd after pg_start_backup()
       (Dave Kerr)
     * Back-patch 9.1 improvement to compress the fsync request queue
       (Robert Haas)
       This improves performance during checkpoints. The 9.1 change has
       now seen enough field testing to seem safe to back-patch.
     * Only allow autovacuum to be auto-canceled by a directly blocked
       process (Tom Lane)
       The original coding could allow inconsistent behavior in some
       cases; in particular, an autovacuum could get canceled after less
       than deadlock_timeout grace period.
     * Improve logging of autovacuum cancels (Robert Haas)
     * Fix log collector so that log_truncate_on_rotation works during the
       very first log rotation after server start (Tom Lane)
     * Ensure that a whole-row reference to a subquery doesn't include any
       extra GROUP BY or ORDER BY columns (Tom Lane)
     * Disallow copying whole-row references in CHECK constraints and
       index definitions during "CREATE TABLE" (Tom Lane)
       This situation can arise in "CREATE TABLE" with LIKE or INHERITS.
       The copied whole-row variable was incorrectly labeled with the row
       type of the original table not the new one. Rejecting the case
       seems reasonable for LIKE, since the row types might well diverge
       later. For INHERITS we should ideally allow it, with an implicit
       coercion to the parent table's row type; but that will require more
       work than seems safe to back-patch.
     * Fix memory leak in ARRAY(SELECT ...) subqueries (Heikki
       Linnakangas, Tom Lane)
     * Fix extraction of common prefixes from regular expressions (Tom
       Lane)
       The code could get confused by quantified parenthesized
       subexpressions, such as ^(foo)?bar. This would lead to incorrect
       index optimization of searches for such patterns.
     * Report errors properly in "contrib/xml2"'s xslt_process() (Tom
       Lane)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2012e for DST law
       changes in Morocco and Tokelau

  * New upstream bug fix release.
     * Fix incorrect password transformation in "contrib/pgcrypto"'s DES
       crypt() function (Solar Designer)
       If a password string contained the byte value 0x80, the remainder
       of the password was ignored, causing the password to be much weaker
       than it appeared. With this fix, the rest of the string is properly
       included in the DES hash. Any stored password values that are
       affected by this bug will thus no longer match, so the stored
       values may need to be updated. (CVE-2012-2143)
     * Ignore SECURITY DEFINER and SET attributes for a procedural
       language's call handler (Tom Lane)
       Applying such attributes to a call handler could crash the server.
       (CVE-2012-2655)
     * Allow numeric timezone offsets in timestamp input to be up to 16
       hours away from UTC (Tom Lane)
       Some historical time zones have offsets larger than 15 hours, the
       previous limit. This could result in dumped data values being
       rejected during reload.
     * Fix timestamp conversion to cope when the given time is exactly the
       last DST transition time for the current timezone (Tom Lane)
       This oversight has been there a long time, but was not noticed
       previously because most DST-using zones are presumed to have an
       indefinite sequence of future DST transitions.
     * Fix text to name and char to name casts to perform string
       truncation correctly in multibyte encodings (Karl Schnaitter)
     * Fix memory copying bug in to_tsquery() (Heikki Linnakangas)
     * Fix slow session startup when pg_attribute is very large (Tom Lane)
       If pg_attribute exceeds one-fourth of shared_buffers, cache
       rebuilding code that is sometimes needed during session start would
       trigger the synchronized-scan logic, causing it to take many times
       longer than normal. The problem was particularly acute if many new
       sessions were starting at once.
     * Ensure sequential scans check for query cancel reasonably often
       (Merlin Moncure)
       A scan encountering many consecutive pages that contain no live
       tuples would not respond to interrupts meanwhile.
     * Ensure the Windows implementation of PGSemaphoreLock() clears
       ImmediateInterruptOK before returning (Tom Lane)
       This oversight meant that a query-cancel interrupt received later
       in the same query could be accepted at an unsafe time, with
       unpredictable but not good consequences.
     * Show whole-row variables safely when printing views or rules (Abbas
       Butt, Tom Lane)
       Corner cases involving ambiguous names (that is, the name could be
       either a table or column name of the query) were printed in an
       ambiguous way, risking that the view or rule would be interpreted
       differently after dump and reload. Avoid the ambiguous case by
       attaching a no-op cast.
     * Ensure autovacuum worker processes perform stack depth checking
       properly (Heikki Linnakangas)
       Previously, infinite recursion in a function invoked by
       auto-"ANALYZE" could crash worker processes.
     * Fix logging collector to not lose log coherency under high load
       (Andrew Dunstan)
       The collector previously could fail to reassemble large messages if
       it got too busy.
     * Fix logging collector to ensure it will restart file rotation after
       receiving SIGHUP (Tom Lane)
     * Fix PL/pgSQL's "GET DIAGNOSTICS" command when the target is the
       function's first variable (Tom Lane)
     * Fix several performance problems in pg_dump when the database
       contains many objects (Jeff Janes, Tom Lane)
       pg_dump could get very slow if the database contained many schemas,
       or if many objects are in dependency loops, or if there are many
       owned sequences.
     * Fix "contrib/dblink"'s dblink_exec() to not leak temporary database
       connections upon error (Tom Lane)
     * Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2012c for DST law
       changes in Antarctica, Armenia, Chile, Cuba, Falkland Islands,
       Gaza, Haiti, Hebron, Morocco, Syria, and Tokelau Islands; also

postgresql-8.3 (8.3.17-0lenny1) oldstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - Fix bugs in information_schema.referential_constraints view.
      This view was being insufficiently careful about matching the
      foreign-key constraint to the depended-on primary or unique key
      constraint. That could result in failure to show a foreign key
      constraint at all, or showing it multiple times, or claiming that
      it depends on a different constraint than the one it really does.
      Since the view definition is installed by initdb, merely upgrading
      will not fix the problem. If you need to fix this in an existing
      installation, you can (as a superuser) drop the information_schema
      schema then re-create it by sourcing
      "SHAREDIR/information_schema.sql". (Run pg_config --sharedir if
      you're uncertain where "SHAREDIR" is.) This must be repeated in
      each database to be fixed.
    - Fix TOAST-related data corruption during CREATE TABLE dest AS
      SELECT - FROM src or INSERT INTO dest SELECT * FROM src.
      If a table has been modified by "ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN", attempts
      to copy its data verbatim to another table could produce corrupt
      results in certain corner cases. The problem can only manifest in
      this precise form in 8.4 and later, but we patched earlier versions
      as well in case there are other code paths that could trigger the
      same bug.
    - Fix race condition during toast table access from stale syscache
      entries. The typical symptom was transient errors like "missing chunk
      number 0 for toast value NNNNN in pg_toast_2619", where the cited toast
      table would always belong to a system catalog.
    - Make DatumGetInetP() unpack inet datums that have a 1-byte header,
      and add a new macro, DatumGetInetPP(), that does not.
    - Improve locale support in money type's input and output.
      Aside from not supporting all standard lc_monetary formatting
      options, the input and output functions were inconsistent, meaning
      there were locales in which dumped money values could not be
      re-read.
    - Don't let transform_null_equals affect CASE foo WHEN NULL ...
      constructs.
    - Change foreign-key trigger creation order to better support
      self-referential foreign keys.
    - Avoid floating-point underflow while tracking buffer allocation
      rate.
    - Preserve blank lines within commands in psql's command history.
      The former behavior could cause problems if an empty line was
      removed from within a string literal, for example.
    - Fix pg_dump to dump user-defined casts between auto-generated
      types, such as table rowtypes.
    - Use the preferred version of xsubpp to build PL/Perl, not
      necessarily the operating system's main copy.
    - Fix incorrect coding in "contrib/dict_int" and "contrib/dict_xsyn".
    - Honor query cancel interrupts promptly in pgstatindex().
    - Ensure VPATH builds properly install all server header files.
    - Shorten file names reported in verbose error messages.
      Regular builds have always reported just the name of the C file
      containing the error message call, but VPATH builds formerly
      reported an absolute path name.

postgresql-8.3 (8.3.16-0lenny1) oldstable-security; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release 8.3.15:
    - Disallow including a composite type in itself.
      This prevents scenarios wherein the server could recurse infinitely
      while processing the composite type. While there are some possible
      uses for such a structure, they don't seem compelling enough to
      justify the effort required to make sure it always works safely.
    - Avoid potential deadlock during catalog cache initialization.
      In some cases the cache loading code would acquire share lock on a
      system index before locking the index's catalog. This could
      deadlock against processes trying to acquire exclusive locks in the
      other, more standard order.
    - Fix dangling-pointer problem in BEFORE ROW UPDATE trigger handling
      when there was a concurrent update to the target tuple.
      This bug has been observed to result in intermittent "cannot
      extract system attribute from virtual tuple" failures while trying
      to do UPDATE RETURNING ctid. There is a very small probability of
      more serious errors, such as generating incorrect index entries for
      the updated tuple.
    - Disallow "DROP TABLE" when there are pending deferred trigger
      events for the table. Formerly the "DROP" would go through, leading to
      "could not open relation with OID nnn" errors when the triggers were
      eventually fired.
    - Fix PL/Python memory leak involving array slices.
    - Fix pg_restore to cope with long lines (over 1KB) in TOC files.
    - Put in more safeguards against crashing due to division-by-zero
      with overly enthusiastic compiler optimization.
  * New upstream bug fix release 8.3.16:
    - Fix bugs in indexing of in-doubt HOT-updated tuples.
      These bugs could result in index corruption after reindexing a
      system catalog. They are not believed to affect user indexes.
    - Fix multiple bugs in GiST index page split processing.
      The probability of occurrence was low, but these could lead to
      index corruption.
    - Fix possible buffer overrun in tsvector_concat().
      The function could underestimate the amount of memory needed for
      its result, leading to server crashes.
    - Fix crash in xml_recv when processing a "standalone" parameter.
    - Avoid possibly accessing off the end of memory in "ANALYZE" and in
      SJIS-2004 encoding conversion.
      This fixes some very-low-probability server crash scenarios.
    - Fix race condition in relcache init file invalidation.
      There was a window wherein a new backend process could read a stale
      init file but miss the inval messages that would tell it the data
      is stale. The result would be bizarre failures in catalog accesses,
      typically "could not read block 0 in file ..." later during
      startup.
    - Fix memory leak at end of a GiST index scan.
      Commands that perform many separate GiST index scans, such as
      verification of a new GiST-based exclusion constraint on a table
      already containing many rows, could transiently require large
      amounts of memory due to this leak.
    - Fix performance problem when constructing a large, lossy bitmap.
    - Fix array- and path-creating functions to ensure padding bytes are
      zeroes. This avoids some situations where the planner will think that
      semantically-equal constants are not equal, resulting in poor
      optimization.
    - Fix dump bug for VALUES in a view.
    - Disallow SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE on sequences.
      This operation doesn't work as expected and can lead to failures.
    - Defend against integer overflow when computing size of a hash table.
    - Fix cases where "CLUSTER" might attempt to access already-removed
      TOAST data.
    - Fix portability bugs in use of credentials control messages for
      "peer" authentication.
    - Fix SSPI login when multiple roundtrips are required.
      The typical symptom of this problem was "The function requested is
      not supported" errors during SSPI login.
    - Fix typo in pg_srand48 seed initialization.
      This led to failure to use all bits of the provided seed. This
      function is not used on most platforms (only those without
      srandom), and the potential security exposure from a
      less-random-than-expected seed seems minimal in any case.
    - Avoid integer overflow when the sum of LIMIT and OFFSET values
      exceeds 2^63.
    - Add overflow checks to int4 and int8 versions of generate_series().
    - Fix trailing-zero removal in to_char(). In a format with FM and no digit
      positions after the decimal point, zeroes to the left of the decimal
      point could be removed incorrectly.
    - Fix pg_size_pretty() to avoid overflow for inputs close to 2^63.
    - Fix psql's counting of script file line numbers during COPY from a
      different file.
    - Fix pg_restore's direct-to-database mode for
      standard_conforming_strings.
      pg_restore could emit incorrect commands when restoring directly to
      a database server from an archive file that had been made with
      standard_conforming_strings set to on.
    - Fix write-past-buffer-end and memory leak in libpq's LDAP service
      lookup code.
    - In libpq, avoid failures when using nonblocking I/O and an SSL
      connection.
    - Improve libpq's handling of failures during connection startup.
      In particular, the response to a server report of fork() failure
      during SSL connection startup is now saner.
    - Improve libpq's error reporting for SSL failures.
    - Make ecpglib write double values with 15 digits precision.
    - In ecpglib, be sure LC_NUMERIC setting is restored after an error.
    - Apply upstream fix for blowfish signed-character bug
      (CVE-2011-2483).
      "contrib/pg_crypto"'s blowfish encryption code could give wrong
      results on platforms where char is signed (which is most), leading
      to encrypted passwords being weaker than they should be.
    - Fix memory leak in "contrib/seg".
    - Fix pgstatindex() to give consistent results for empty indexes.
    - Allow building with perl 5.14 (Alex Hunsaker)

postgresql-8.3 (8.3.14-0lenny1) stable-security; urgency=low

  * New upstream security/bug fix release:
    - Fix buffer overrun in "contrib/intarray"'s input function for the
      query_int type.
      This bug is a security risk since the function's return address
      could be overwritten. Thanks to Apple Inc's security team for
      reporting this issue and supplying the fix. (CVE-2010-4015)
    - Avoid failures when "EXPLAIN" tries to display a simple-form CASE
      expression.
      If the CASE's test expression was a constant, the planner could
      simplify the CASE into a form that confused the expression-display
      code, resulting in "unexpected CASE WHEN clause" errors.
    - Fix assignment to an array slice that is before the existing range
      of subscripts.
      If there was a gap between the newly added subscripts and the first
      pre-existing subscript, the code miscalculated how many entries
      needed to be copied from the old array's null bitmap, potentially
      leading to data corruption or crash.
    - Avoid unexpected conversion overflow in planner for very distant
      date values.
      The date type supports a wider range of dates than can be
      represented by the timestamp types, but the planner assumed it
      could always convert a date to timestamp with impunity.
    - Fix pg_restore's text output for large objects (BLOBs) when
      standard_conforming_strings is on.
      Although restoring directly to a database worked correctly, string
      escaping was incorrect if pg_restore was asked for SQL text output
      and standard_conforming_strings had been enabled in the source
      database.
    - Fix erroneous parsing of tsquery values containing ... &
      !(subexpression) | ... .
      Queries containing this combination of operators were not executed
      correctly. The same error existed in "contrib/intarray"'s query_int
      type and "contrib/ltree"'s ltxtquery type.
    - Fix bug in "contrib/seg"'s GiST picksplit algorithm.
      This could result in considerable inefficiency, though not actually
      incorrect answers, in a GiST index on a seg column. If you have
      such an index, consider "REINDEX"ing it after installing this
      update. (This is identical to the bug that was fixed in
      "contrib/cube" in the previous update.)

postgresql-8.3 (8.3.13-0lenny1) stable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - Force the default wal_sync_method to be fdatasync on Linux.
      The default on Linux has actually been fdatasync for many years,
      but recent kernel changes caused PostgreSQL to choose open_datasync
      instead. This choice did not result in any performance improvement,
      and caused outright failures on certain filesystems, notably ext4
      with the data=journal mount option.
    - Fix assorted bugs in WAL replay logic for GIN indexes.
      This could result in "bad buffer id: 0" failures or corruption of
      index contents during replication.
    - Fix recovery from base backup when the starting checkpoint WAL
      record is not in the same WAL segment as its redo point.
    - Fix persistent slowdown of autovacuum workers when multiple workers
      remain active for a long time.
      The effective vacuum_cost_limit for an autovacuum worker could drop
      to nearly zero if it processed enough tables, causing it to run
      extremely slowly.
    - Add support for detecting register-stack overrun on IA64.
      The IA64 architecture has two hardware stacks. Full prevention of
      stack-overrun failures requires checking both.
    - Add a check for stack overflow in copyObject().
      Certain code paths could crash due to stack overflow given a
      sufficiently complex query.
    - Fix detection of page splits in temporary GiST indexes.
      It is possible to have a "concurrent" page split in a temporary
      index, if for example there is an open cursor scanning the index
      when an insertion is done. GiST failed to detect this case and
      hence could deliver wrong results when execution of the cursor
      continued.
    - Avoid memory leakage while "ANALYZE"'ing complex index expressions.
    - Ensure an index that uses a whole-row Var still depends on its
      table.
      An index declared like create index i on t (foo(t.-)) would not
      automatically get dropped when its table was dropped.
    - Do not "inline" a SQL function with multiple OUT parameters.
      This avoids a possible crash due to loss of information about the
      expected result rowtype.
    - Behave correctly if ORDER BY, LIMIT, FOR UPDATE, or WITH is
      attached to the VALUES part of INSERT ... VALUES.
    - Fix constant-folding of COALESCE() expressions.
      The planner would sometimes attempt to evaluate sub-expressions
      that in fact could never be reached, possibly leading to unexpected
      errors.
    - Fix postmaster crash when connection acceptance (accept() or one of
      the calls made immediately after it) fails, and the postmaster was
      compiled with GSSAPI support.
    - Fix missed unlink of temporary files when log_temp_files is active.
      If an error occurred while attempting to emit the log message, the
      unlink was not done, resulting in accumulation of temp files.
    - Add print functionality for InhRelation nodes.
      This avoids a failure when debug_print_parse is enabled and certain
      types of query are executed.
    - Fix incorrect calculation of distance from a point to a horizontal
      line segment.
      This bug affected several different geometric distance-measurement
      operators.
    - Fix PL/pgSQL's handling of "simple" expressions to not fail in
      recursion or error-recovery cases.
    - Fix PL/Python's handling of set-returning functions.
      Attempts to call SPI functions within the iterator generating a set
      result would fail.
    - Fix bug in "contrib/cube"'s GiST picksplit algorithm.
      This could result in considerable inefficiency, though not actually
      incorrect answers, in a GiST index on a cube column. If you have
      such an index, consider "REINDEX"ing it after installing this
      update.
    - Don't emit "identifier will be truncated" notices in
      "contrib/dblink" except when creating new connections.
    - Fix potential coredump on missing public key in "contrib/pgcrypto".
    - Fix memory leak in "contrib/xml2"'s XPath query functions.

postgresql-8.3 (8.3.12-0lenny1) stable-security; urgency=low

  * New upstream security/bug fix release:
    - Use a separate interpreter for each calling SQL userid in PL/Perl
      and PL/Tcl.
      This change prevents security problems that can be caused by
      subverting Perl or Tcl code that will be executed later in the same
      session under another SQL user identity (for example, within a
      SECURITY DEFINER function). Most scripting languages offer numerous
      ways that that might be done, such as redefining standard functions
      or operators called by the target function. Without this change,
      any SQL user with Perl or Tcl language usage rights can do
      essentially anything with the SQL privileges of the target
      function's owner.
      The cost of this change is that intentional communication among
      Perl and Tcl functions becomes more difficult. To provide an escape
      hatch, PL/PerlU and PL/TclU functions continue to use only one
      interpreter per session. This is not considered a security issue
      since all such functions execute at the trust level of a database
      superuser already.
      It is likely that third-party procedural languages that claim to
      offer trusted execution have similar security issues. We advise
      contacting the authors of any PL you are depending on for
      security-critical purposes.
      Our thanks to Tim Bunce for pointing out this issue
      (CVE-2010-3433).
    - Prevent possible crashes in pg_get_expr() by disallowing it from
      being called with an argument that is not one of the system catalog
      columns it's intended to be used with.
    - Fix incorrect usage of non-strict OR joinclauses in Append
      indexscans.
      This is a back-patch of an 8.4 fix that was missed in the 8.3
      branch. This corrects an error introduced in 8.3.8 that could cause
      incorrect results for outer joins when the inner relation is an
      inheritance tree or UNION ALL subquery.
    - Fix possible duplicate scans of UNION ALL member relations.
    - Fix "cannot handle unplanned sub-select" error.
      This occurred when a sub-select contains a join alias reference
      that expands into an expression containing another sub-select.
    - Fix failure to mark cached plans as transient.
      If a plan is prepared while "CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY" is in
      progress for one of the referenced tables, it is supposed to be
      re-planned once the index is ready for use. This was not happening
      reliably.
    - Reduce PANIC to ERROR in some occasionally-reported btree failure
      cases, and provide additional detail in the resulting error
      messages.
      This should improve the system's robustness with corrupted indexes.
    - Prevent show_session_authorization() from crashing within
      autovacuum processes.
    - Defend against functions returning setof record where not all the
      returned rows are actually of the same rowtype.
    - Fix possible failure when hashing a pass-by-reference function
      result.
    - Improve merge join's handling of NULLs in the join columns.
      A merge join can now stop entirely upon reaching the first NULL, if
      the sort order is such that NULLs sort high.
    - Take care to fsync the contents of lockfiles (both "postmaster.pid"
      and the socket lockfile) while writing them.
      This omission could result in corrupted lockfile contents if the
      machine crashes shortly after postmaster start. That could in turn
      prevent subsequent attempts to start the postmaster from
      succeeding, until the lockfile is manually removed.
    - Avoid recursion while assigning XIDs to heavily-nested
      subtransactions.
      The original coding could result in a crash if there was limited
      stack space.
    - Avoid holding open old WAL segments in the walwriter process.
      The previous coding would prevent removal of no-longer-needed
      segments.
    - Fix log_line_prefix's %i escape, which could produce junk early in
      backend startup.
    - Fix possible data corruption in "ALTER TABLE ... SET TABLESPACE"
      when archiving is enabled.
    - Allow "CREATE DATABASE" and "ALTER DATABASE ... SET TABLESPACE" to
      be interrupted by query-cancel.
    - Fix "REASSIGN OWNED" to handle operator classes and families.
    - Fix possible core dump when comparing two empty tsquery values.
    - Fix LIKE's handling of patterns containing % followed by _.
      We've fixed this before, but there were still some
      incorrectly-handled cases.
    - In PL/Python, defend against null pointer results from
      PyCObject_AsVoidPtr and PyCObject_FromVoidPtr.
    - Make psql recognize "DISCARD ALL" as a command that should not be
      encased in a transaction block in autocommit-off mode.
    - Fix ecpg to process data from RETURNING clauses correctly.
    - Improve "contrib/dblink"'s handling of tables containing dropped
      columns.
    - Fix connection leak after "duplicate connection name" errors in
      "contrib/dblink".
    - Fix "contrib/dblink" to handle connection names longer than 62
      bytes correctly.
    - Add hstore(text, text) function to "contrib/hstore".
      This function is the recommended substitute for the now-deprecated
      => operator. It was back-patched so that future-proofed code can be
      used with older server versions. Note that the patch will be
      effective only after "contrib/hstore" is installed or reinstalled
      in a particular database. Users might prefer to execute the "CREATE
      FUNCTION" command by hand, instead.
    - Update build infrastructure and documentation to reflect the source
      code repository's move from CVS to Git.

postgresql-8.3 (8.3.11-0lenny1) stable-security; urgency=high

  * New upstream security/bug fix release:
    - Enforce restrictions in plperl using an opmask applied to the whole
      interpreter, instead of using "Safe.pm".
      Recent developments have convinced us that "Safe.pm" is too
      insecure to rely on for making plperl trustable. This change
      removes use of "Safe.pm" altogether, in favor of using a separate
      interpreter with an opcode mask that is always applied. Pleasant
      side effects of the change include that it is now possible to use
      Perl's strict pragma in a natural way in plperl, and that Perl's $a
      and $b variables work as expected in sort routines, and that
      function compilation is significantly faster. (CVE-2010-1169)
    - Prevent PL/Tcl from executing untrustworthy code from pltcl_modules.
      PL/Tcl's feature for autoloading Tcl code from a database table
      could be exploited for trojan-horse attacks, because there was no
      restriction on who could create or insert into that table. This
      change disables the feature unless pltcl_modules is owned by a
      superuser. (However, the permissions on the table are not checked,
      so installations that really need a less-than-secure modules table
      can still grant suitable privileges to trusted non-superusers.)
      Also, prevent loading code into the unrestricted "normal" Tcl
      interpreter unless we are really going to execute a pltclu
      function. (CVE-2010-1170)
    - Fix possible crash if a cache reset message is received during
      rebuild of a relcache entry.
      This error was introduced in 8.3.10 while fixing a related failure.
    - Apply per-function GUC settings while running the language
      validator for the function.
      This avoids failures if the function's code is invalid without the
      setting; an example is that SQL functions may not parse if the
      search_path is not correct.
    - Do not allow an unprivileged user to reset superuser-only parameter
      settings.
      Previously, if an unprivileged user ran ALTER USER ... RESET ALL
      for himself, or ALTER DATABASE ... RESET ALL for a database he
      owns, this would remove all special parameter settings for the user
      or database, even ones that are only supposed to be changeable by a
      superuser. Now, the "ALTER" will only remove the parameters that
      the user has permission to change.
    - Avoid possible crash during backend shutdown if shutdown occurs
      when a CONTEXT addition would be made to log entries.
      In some cases the context-printing function would fail because the
      current transaction had already been rolled back when it came time
      to print a log message.
    - Ensure the archiver process responds to changes in archive_command
      as soon as possible.
    - Update pl/perl's "ppport.h" for modern Perl versions.
    - Fix assorted memory leaks in pl/python.
    - Prevent infinite recursion in psql when expanding a variable that
      refers to itself.
    - Fix psql's \copy to not add spaces around a dot within \copy
      (select ...).
      Addition of spaces around the decimal point in a numeric literal
      would result in a syntax error.
    - Fix unnecessary "GIN indexes do not support whole-index scans"
      errors for unsatisfiable queries using "contrib/intarray" operators.
    - Ensure that "contrib/pgstattuple" functions respond to cancel
      interrupts promptly.

postgresql-8.3 (8.3.10-0lenny1) stable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - Add new configuration parameter ssl_renegotiation_limit to control
      how often we do session key renegotiation for an SSL connection.
      This can be set to zero to disable renegotiation completely, which
      may be required if a broken SSL library is used. In particular,
      some vendors are shipping stopgap patches for CVE-2009-3555 that
      cause renegotiation attempts to fail.
    - Fix possible deadlock during backend startup.
    - Fix possible crashes due to not handling errors during relcache
      reload cleanly.
    - Fix possible crash due to use of dangling pointer to a cached plan.
    - Fix possible crashes when trying to recover from a failure in
      subtransaction start.
    - Fix server memory leak associated with use of savepoints and a
      client encoding different from server's encoding.
    - Fix incorrect WAL data emitted during end-of-recovery cleanup of a
      GIST index page split.
      This would result in index corruption, or even more likely an error
      during WAL replay, if we were unlucky enough to crash during
      end-of-recovery cleanup after having completed an incomplete GIST
      insertion.
    - Make substring() for bit types treat any negative length as meaning
      "all the rest of the string".
      The previous coding treated only -1 that way, and would produce an
      invalid result value for other negative values, possibly leading to
      a crash (CVE-2010-0442). (Closes: #567058)
    - Fix integer-to-bit-string conversions to handle the first
      fractional byte correctly when the output bit width is wider than
      the given integer by something other than a multiple of 8 bits.
    - Fix some cases of pathologically slow regular expression matching.
    - Fix assorted crashes in xml processing caused by sloppy memory
      management.
      This is a back-patch of changes first applied in 8.4. The 8.3 code
      was known buggy, but the new code was sufficiently different to not
      want to back-patch it until it had gotten some field testing.
    - Fix bug with trying to update a field of an element of a
      composite-type array column.
    - Fix the STOP WAL LOCATION entry in backup history files to report
      the next WAL segment's name when the end location is exactly at a
      segment boundary.
    - Fix some more cases of temporary-file leakage.
      This corrects a problem introduced in the previous minor release.
      One case that failed is when a plpgsql function returning set is
      called within another function's exception handler.
    - Improve constraint exclusion processing of boolean-variable cases,
      in particular make it possible to exclude a partition that has a
      "bool_column = false" constraint.
    - When reading "pg_hba.conf" and related files, do not treat
      @something as a file inclusion request if the @ appears inside
      quote marks; also, never treat @ by itself as a file inclusion
      request.
      This prevents erratic behavior if a role or database name starts
      with @. If you need to include a file whose path name contains
      spaces, you can still do so, but you must write @"/path to/file"
      rather than putting the quotes around the whole construct.
    - Prevent infinite loop on some platforms if a directory is named as
      an inclusion target in "pg_hba.conf" and related files.
    - Fix possible infinite loop if SSL_read or SSL_write fails without
      setting errno.
      This is reportedly possible with some Windows versions of openssl.
    - Disallow GSSAPI authentication on local connections, since it
      requires a hostname to function correctly.
    - Make ecpg report the proper SQLSTATE if the connection disappears.
    - Fix psql's numericlocale option to not format strings it shouldn't
      in latex and troff output formats.
    - Make psql return the correct exit status (3) when ON_ERROR_STOP and
      --single-transaction are both specified and an error occurs during
      the implied "COMMIT".
    - Fix plpgsql failure in one case where a composite column is set to
      NULL.
    - Fix possible failure when calling PL/Perl functions from PL/PerlU
      or vice versa.
    - Add volatile markings in PL/Python to avoid possible
      compiler-specific misbehavior.
    - Ensure PL/Tcl initializes the Tcl interpreter fully.
      The only known symptom of this oversight is that the Tcl clock
      command misbehaves if using Tcl 8.5 or later.
    - Prevent crash in "contrib/dblink" when too many key columns are
      specified to a dblink_build_sql_- function.
    - Allow zero-dimensional arrays in "contrib/ltree" operations.
      This case was formerly rejected as an error, but it's more
      convenient to treat it the same as a zero-element array. In
      particular this avoids unnecessary failures when an ltree operation
      is applied to the result of ARRAY(SELECT ...) and the sub-select
      returns no rows.
    - Fix assorted crashes in "contrib/xml2" caused by sloppy memory
      management.
  * Add 00cvs-unregister-ssl-callbacks.patch: Properly unregister OpenSSL
    callbacks when libpq is done with it's connection. Thanks Ondřej Surý for

  * New upstream security/bug fix release:
    - Protect against indirect security threats caused by index functions
      changing session-local state. This change prevents allegedly-immutable
      index functions from possibly subverting a superuser's session
      (CVE-2009-4136).
    - Reject SSL certificates containing an embedded null byte in the
      common name (CN) field. This prevents unintended matching of a
      certificate to a server or client name during SSL validation
      (CVE-2009-4034).
    - Fix possible crash during backend-startup-time cache initialization.
    - Avoid crash on empty thesaurus dictionary.
    - Prevent signals from interrupting VACUUM at unsafe times.
    - Fix possible crash due to integer overflow in hash table size
      calculation.
    - Fix very rare crash in inet/cidr comparisons.
    - Ensure that shared tuple-level locks held by prepared transactions
      are not ignored.
    - Fix premature drop of temporary files used for a cursor that is
      accessed within a subtransaction.
    - Fix memory leak in syslogger process when rotating to a new CSV
      logfile.
    - Fix incorrect logic for GiST index page splits, when the split
      depends on a non-first column of the index.
    - Don't error out if recycling or removing an old WAL file fails at
      the end of checkpoint. It's better to treat the problem as non-fatal and
      allow the checkpoint to complete. Future checkpoints will retry the
      removal.  Such problems are not expected in normal operation, but have
      been seen to be caused by misdesigned Windows anti-virus and backup
      software.
    - Fix PAM password processing to be more robust.
    - Raise the maximum authentication token (Kerberos ticket) size in
      GSSAPI and SSPI authentication methods. While the old 2000-byte limit
      was more than enough for Unix Kerberos implementations, tickets issued
      by Windows Domain Controllers can be much larger.
    - Re-enable collection of access statistics for sequences. This used to
      work but was broken in 8.3.
    - Fix processing of ownership dependencies during CREATE OR REPLACE
      FUNCTION.
    - Fix incorrect handling of WHERE "x"="x" conditions.
      In some cases these could get ignored as redundant, but they aren't
      -- they're equivalent to "x" IS NOT NULL.
    - Make text search parser accept underscores in XML attributes.
    - Fix encoding handling in xml binary input. If the XML header doesn't
      specify an encoding, we now assume UTF-8 by default; the previous
      handling was inconsistent.
    - Fix bug with calling plperl from plperlu or vice versa.
    - Fix session-lifespan memory leak when a PL/Perl function is
      redefined.
    - Ensure that Perl arrays are properly converted to PostgreSQL arrays
      when returned by a set-returning PL/Perl function.
    - Fix rare crash in exception processing in PL/Python.
    - Make the postmaster ignore any application_name parameter in
      connection request packets, to improve compatibility with future
      libpq versions.

postgresql-8.3 (8.3.8-0lenny1) stable-security; urgency=high

  * New upstream security/bug fix release:
    - Disallow "RESET ROLE" and "RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" inside
      security-definer functions. This covers a case that was missed in the
      previous patch that disallowed "SET ROLE" and "SET SESSION
      AUTHORIZATION" inside security-definer functions. [CVE-2007-6600]
    - Force WAL segment switch during pg_start_backup(). This avoids corner
      cases that could render a base backup unusable.
    - Make "LOAD" of an already-loaded loadable module into a no-op.
      Formerly, "LOAD" would attempt to unload and re-load the module,
      but this is unsafe and not all that useful.
    - Disallow empty passwords during LDAP authentication.
    - Fix handling of sub-SELECTs appearing in the arguments of an
      outer-level aggregate function.
    - Fix bugs associated with fetching a whole-row value from the output
      of a Sort or Materialize plan node.
    - Prevent synchronize_seqscans from changing the results of
      scrollable and WITH HOLD cursors.
    - Revert planner change that disabled partial-index and constraint
      exclusion optimizations when there were more than 100 clauses in an
      AND or OR list.
    - Fix hash calculation for data type interval. This corrects wrong results
      for hash joins on interval values. It also changes the contents of hash
      indexes on interval columns. If you have any such indexes, you must
      "REINDEX" them after updating.
    - Treat to_char(..., 'TH') as an uppercase ordinal suffix with
      'HH'/'HH12'. It was previously handled as 'th' (lowercase).
    - Fix overflow for INTERVAL 'x ms' when "x" is more than 2 million
      and integer datetimes are in use.
    - Fix calculation of distance between a point and a line segment.
      This led to incorrect results from a number of geometric operators.
    - Fix money data type to work in locales where currency amounts have
      no fractional digits, e.g. Japan.
    - Fix LIKE for case where pattern contains %_.
    - Properly round datetime input like 00:12:57.9999999999999999999999999999.
    - Fix memory leaks in XML operations.
    - Fix poor choice of page split point in GiST R-tree operator classes.
    - Ensure that a "fast shutdown" request will forcibly terminate open
      sessions, even if a "smart shutdown" was already in progress.
    - Avoid performance degradation in bulk inserts into GIN indexes when
      the input values are (nearly) in sorted order.
    - Correctly enforce NOT NULL domain constraints in some contexts in
      PL/pgSQL.
    - Fix portability issues in plperl initialization.
    - Fix pg_ctl to not go into an infinite loop if "postgresql.conf" is
      empty.
    - Improve pg_dump's efficiency when there are many large objects.
    - Use SIGUSR1, not SIGQUIT, as the failover signal for pg_standby.
    - Make pg_standby's maxretries option behave as documented.
    - Make "contrib/hstore" throw an error when a key or value is too
      long to fit in its data structure, rather than silently truncating
      it.
    - Fix "contrib/xml2"'s xslt_process() to properly handle the maximum
      number of parameters (twenty).
    - Improve robustness of libpq's code to recover from errors during
      "COPY FROM STDIN".

postgresql-8.3 (8.3.7-0lenny1) stable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release:
     - Prevent error recursion crashes when encoding conversion fails.
       This change extends fixes made in the last two minor releases for
       related failure scenarios. The previous fixes were narrowly
       tailored for the original problem reports, but we have now
       recognized that *any* error thrown by an encoding conversion
       function could potentially lead to infinite recursion while trying
       to report the error. The solution therefore is to disable
       translation and encoding conversion and report the plain-ASCII form
       of any error message, if we find we have gotten into a recursive
       error reporting situation. (Closes: #517405)
     - Disallow "CREATE CONVERSION" with the wrong encodings for the
       specified conversion function. This prevents one possible scenario for
       encoding conversion failure. The previous change is a backstop to guard
       against other kinds of failures in the same area.
     - Fix xpath() to not modify the path expression unless necessary, and
       to make a saner attempt at it when necessary.
       The SQL standard suggests that xpath should work on data that is a
       document fragment, but libxml doesn't support that, and indeed it's
       not clear that this is sensible according to the XPath standard.
       xpath attempted to work around this mismatch by modifying both the
       data and the path expression, but the modification was buggy and
       could cause valid searches to fail. Now, xpath checks whether the
       data is in fact a well-formed document, and if so invokes libxml
       with no change to the data or path expression. Otherwise, a
       different modification method that is somewhat less likely to fail
       is used.
       Note: The new modification method is still not 100% satisfactory,
       and it seems likely that no real solution is possible. This patch
       should therefore be viewed as a band-aid to keep from breaking
       existing applications unnecessarily. It is likely that PostgreSQL
       8.4 will simply reject use of xpath on data that is not a
       well-formed document.
     - Fix core dump when to_char() is given format codes that are
       inappropriate for the type of the data argument.
     - Fix extreme inefficiency in text search parser's handling of an
       email-like string containing multiple @ characters.
     - Fix planner problem with sub-"SELECT" in the output list of a
       larger subquery.
     - Fix decompilation of CASE WHEN with an implicit coercion.
     - Fix possible misassignment of the owner of a TOAST table's rowtype.
       If "CLUSTER" or a rewriting variant of "ALTER TABLE" were executed
       by someone other than the table owner, the pg_type entry for the
       table's TOAST table would end up marked as owned by that someone.
       This caused no immediate problems, since the permissions on the
       TOAST rowtype aren't examined by any ordinary database operation.
       However, it could lead to unexpected failures if one later tried to
       drop the role that issued the command (in 8.1 or 8.2), or "owner of
       data type appears to be invalid" warnings from pg_dump after having
       done so (in 8.3).
     - Change "UNLISTEN" to exit quickly if the current session has never
       executed any "LISTEN" command.
       Most of the time this is not a particularly useful optimization,
       but since "DISCARD ALL" invokes "UNLISTEN", the previous coding
       caused a substantial performance problem for applications that made
       heavy use of "DISCARD ALL".
     - Fix PL/pgSQL to not treat INTO after "INSERT" as an INTO-variables
       clause anywhere in the string, not only at the start; in
       particular, don't fail for "INSERT INTO" within "CREATE RULE".
     - Clean up PL/pgSQL error status variables fully at block exit.
       This is not a problem for PL/pgSQL itself, but the omission could
       cause the PL/pgSQL Debugger to crash while examining the state of a
       function.

postgresql-8.3 (8.3.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - Make "DISCARD ALL" release advisory locks, in addition to
      everything it already did. This was decided to be the most
      appropriate behavior. This could affect existing applications,
      however.
    - Fix whole-index GiST scans to work correctly.  This error could
      cause rows to be lost if a table is clustered on a GiST index.
    - Fix crash of xmlconcat(NULL).
    - Fix possible crash in ispell dictionary if high-bit-set characters
      are used as flags.  This is known to be done by one widely
      available Norwegian dictionary, and the same condition may exist
      in others. (Closes: #513580)
    - Fix misordering of pg_dump output for composite types.  The most
      likely problem was for user-defined operator classes to be
      dumped after indexes or views that needed them.
    - Improve handling of URLs in headline() function.
    - Improve handling of overlength headlines in headline() function.
    - Prevent possible Assert failure or misconversion if an encoding
      conversion is created with the wrong conversion function for the
      specified pair of encodings.
    - Fix possible Assert failure if a statement executed in PL/pgSQL is
      rewritten into another kind of statement, for example if an
      "INSERT" is rewritten into an "UPDATE".
    - Ensure that a snapshot is available to datatype input functions.
      This primarily affects domains that are declared with CHECK
      constraints involving user-defined stable or immutable functions.
      Such functions typically fail if no snapshot has been set.
    - Make it safer for SPI-using functions to be used within datatype
      I/O; in particular, to be used in domain check constraints.
    - Avoid unnecessary locking of small tables in "VACUUM".
    - Fix a problem that sometimes kept "ALTER TABLE ENABLE/DISABLE RULE"
      from being recognized by active sessions.
    - Fix a problem that made UPDATE RETURNING tableoid return zero
      instead of the correct OID.
    - Allow functions declared as taking ANYARRAY to work on the
      pg_statistic columns of that type.
      This used to work, but was unintentionally broken in 8.3.
    - Fix planner misestimation of selectivity when transitive equality
      is applied to an outer-join clause.
      This could result in bad plans for queries like ... from a left
      join b on a.a1 = b.b1 where a.a1 = 42 ...
    - Improve optimizer's handling of long IN lists.  This change
      avoids wasting large amounts of time on such lists when
      constraint exclusion is enabled.
    - Prevent synchronous scan during GIN index build.  Because GIN is
      optimized for inserting tuples in increasing TID order, choosing
      to use a synchronous scan could slow the build by a factor of
      three or more.
    - Ensure that the contents of a holdable cursor don't depend on the
      contents of TOAST tables.  Previously, large field values in a
      cursor result might be represented as TOAST pointers, which
      would fail if the referenced table got dropped before the cursor
      is read, or if the large value is deleted and then vacuumed
      away. This cannot happen with an ordinary cursor, but it could
      with a cursor that is held past its creating transaction.
    - Fix memory leak when a set-returning function is terminated without
      reading its whole result.
    - Fix encoding conversion problems in XML functions when the database
      encoding isn't UTF-8.
    - Fix "contrib/dblink"'s dblink_get_result(text,bool) function.
    - Fix possible garbage output from "contrib/sslinfo" functions.
    - Fix incorrect behavior of "contrib/tsearch2" compatibility trigger
      when it's fired more than once in a command.
    - Fix possible mis-signaling in autovacuum.
    - Fix ecpg's handling of varchar structs.
    - Make all documentation reference pgsql-bugs and/or pgsql-hackers as
      appropriate, instead of the now-decommissioned pgsql-ports and
      pgsql-patches mailing lists.

postgresql-8.3 (8.3.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - Fix GiST index corruption due to marking the wrong index entry
      "dead" after a deletion. This would result in index searches failing to
      find rows they should have found.
    - Fix backend crash when the client encoding cannot represent a
      localized error message.
    - Fix possible crash in bytea-to-XML mapping.
    - Fix possible crash when deeply nested functions are invoked from a
      trigger.
    - Improve optimization of "expression" IN ("expression-list") queries.
    - Fix mis-expansion of rule queries when a sub-SELECT appears in a
      function call in FROM, a multi-row VALUES list, or a RETURNING list.
    - Fix Assert failure during rescan of an IS NULL search of a GiST
      index.
    - Fix memory leak during rescan of a hashed aggregation plan.
    - Ensure an error is reported when a newly-defined PL/pgSQL trigger
      function is invoked as a normal function.
    - Force a checkpoint before "CREATE DATABASE" starts to copy files.
      This prevents a possible failure if files had recently been deleted
      in the source database.
    - Prevent possible collision of relfilenode numbers when moving a
      table to another tablespace with "ALTER SET TABLESPACE". The command
      tried to re-use the existing filename, instead of picking one that is
      known unused in the destination directory.
    - Fix incorrect text search headline generation when single query
      item matches first word of text.
    - Fix improper display of fractional seconds in interval values when
      using a non-ISO datestyle.
    - Make ILIKE compare characters case-insensitively even when they're
      escaped.
    - Ensure "DISCARD" is handled properly by statement logging.
    - Fix incorrect logging of last-completed-transaction time during
      PITR recovery.
    - Ensure SPI_getvalue and SPI_getbinval behave correctly when the
      passed tuple and tuple descriptor have different numbers of columns.
      This situation is normal when a table has had columns added or
      removed, but these two functions didn't handle it properly. The
      only likely consequence is an incorrect error indication.
    - Mark SessionReplicationRole as PGDLLIMPORT so it can be used by
      Slony on Windows.
    - Fix small memory leak when using libpq's gsslib parameter.
      The space used by the parameter string was not freed at connection
      close.
    - Ensure libgssapi is linked into libpq if needed.
    - Fix ecpg's parsing of "CREATE ROLE".
    - Fix recent breakage of pg_ctl restart.

postgresql-8.3 (8.3.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release:
    - Fix bug in btree WAL recovery code. Recovery failed if the WAL ended
      partway through a page split operation.
    - Fix potential use of wrong cutoff XID for HOT page pruning.
      This error created a risk of corruption in system catalogs that are
      consulted by "VACUUM": dead tuple versions might be removed too
      soon. The impact of this on actual database operations would be
      minimal, since the system doesn't follow MVCC rules while examining
      catalogs, but it might result in transiently wrong output from
      pg_dump or other client programs.
    - Fix potential miscalculation of datfrozenxid.
    - Fix incorrect HOT updates after pg_class is reindexed.
      Corruption of pg_class could occur if REINDEX TABLE pg_class was
      followed in the same session by an ALTER TABLE RENAME or ALTER
      TABLE SET SCHEMA command.
    - Fix missed "combo cid" case. This error made rows incorrectly invisible
      to a transaction in which they had been deleted by multiple
      subtransactions that all aborted.
    - Prevent autovacuum from crashing if the table it's currently
      checking is deleted at just the wrong time.
    - Widen local lock counters from 32 to 64 bits. This responds to reports
      that the counters could overflow in sufficiently long transactions,
      leading to unexpected "lock is already held" errors.
    - Fix possible duplicate output of tuples during a GiST index scan.
    - Regenerate foreign key checking queries from scratch when either
      table is modified. Previously, 8.3 would attempt to replan the query,
      but would work from previously generated query text. This led to
      failures if a table or column was renamed.
    - Fix missed permissions checks when a view contains a simple UNION
      ALL construct. Permissions for the referenced tables were checked
      properly, but not permissions for the view itself.
    - Add checks in executor startup to ensure that the tuples produced
      by an "INSERT" or "UPDATE" will match the target table's current
      rowtype. This situation is believed to be impossible in 8.3, but it can
      happen in prior releases, so a check seems prudent.
    - Fix possible repeated drops during "DROP OWNED". This would typically
      result in strange errors such as "cache lookup failed for relation NNN".
    - Fix several memory leaks in XML operations.
    - Fix xmlserialize() to raise error properly for unacceptable target
      data type.
    - Fix a couple of places that mis-handled multibyte characters in
      text search configuration file parsing. Certain characters occurring in
      configuration files would always cause "invalid byte sequence for
      encoding" failures.
    - Provide file name and line number location for all errors reported
      in text search configuration files.
    - Fix AT TIME ZONE to first try to interpret its timezone argument as
      a timezone abbreviation, and only try it as a full timezone name if
      that fails, rather than the other way around as formerly.
    - Fix datetime input functions to correctly detect integer overflow
      when running on a 64-bit platform.
    - Prevent integer overflows during units conversion when displaying a
      configuration parameter that has units.
    - Improve performance of writing very long log messages to syslog.
    - Allow spaces in the suffix part of an LDAP URL in "pg_hba.conf".
    - Fix bug in backwards scanning of a cursor on a SELECT DISTINCT ON
      query.
    - Fix planner bug that could improperly push down IS NULL tests below
      an outer join.
    - Fix planner bug with nested sub-select expressions.
    - Fix planner to estimate that GROUP BY expressions yielding boolean
      results always result in two groups, regardless of the expressions'
      contents.
    - Fix PL/PgSQL to not fail when a FOR loop's target variable is a
      record containing composite-type fields.
    - Fix PL/Tcl to behave correctly with Tcl 8.5, and to be more careful
      about the encoding of data sent to or from Tcl.
    - Improve performance of PQescapeBytea().
    - Fix ecpg to handle variables properly in "SET" commands.
    - Improve pg_dump and pg_restore's error reporting after failure to
      send a SQL command.
    - Fix pg_ctl to properly preserve postmaster command-line arguments
      across a restart.
    - Fix erroneous WAL file cutoff point calculation in pg_standby.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version (no changes necessary).
  * debian/control: intarray contrib module was renamed to _int. (LP: #250483)

postgresql-8.3 (8.3.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release (note that 8.3.2 was never officially released
    due to the discovery of another major bug):
    - Make pg_get_ruledef() parenthesize negative constants.
      Before this fix, a negative constant in a view or rule might be
      dumped as, say, -42::integer, which is subtly incorrect: it should
      be (-42)::integer due to operator precedence rules. Usually this
      would make little difference, but it could interact with another
      recent patch to cause PostgreSQL to reject what had been a valid
      "SELECT DISTINCT" view query. Since this could result in pg_dump
      output failing to reload, it is being treated as a high-priority
      fix. The only released versions in which dump output is actually
      incorrect are 8.3.1 and 8.2.7.
    - Make "ALTER AGGREGATE ... OWNER TO" update pg_shdepend.
      This oversight could lead to problems if the aggregate was later
      involved in a "DROP OWNED" or "REASSIGN OWNED" operation.
    - Fix incorrect archive truncation point calculation for the %r macro
      in recovery_command parameters. This could lead to data loss if a
      warm-standby script relied on %r to decide when to throw away WAL
      segment files.
    - Fix "ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ... PRIMARY KEY" so that the new column
      is correctly checked to see if it's been initialized to all
      non-nulls.
    - Fix "REASSIGN OWNED" so that it works on procedural languages too.
    - Fix problems with "SELECT FOR UPDATE/SHARE" occurring as a subquery
      in a query with a non-"SELECT" top-level operation.
    - Fix possible "CREATE TABLE" failure when inheriting the "same"
      constraint from multiple parent relations that inherited that
      constraint from a common ancestor.
    - Fix pg_get_ruledef() to show the alias, if any, attached to the
      target table of an "UPDATE" or "DELETE".
    - Restore the pre-8.3 behavior that an out-of-range block number in a
      TID being used in a TidScan plan results in silently not matching
      any rows. 8.3.0 and 8.3.1 threw an error instead.
    - Fix GIN bug that could result in a too many LWLocks taken failure.
    - Fix broken GiST comparison function for tsquery.
    - Fix tsvector_update_trigger() and ts_stat() to accept domains over
      the types they expect to work with.
    - Fix failure to support enum data types as foreign keys.
    - Avoid possible crash when decompressing corrupted data.
    - Fix race conditions between delayed unlinks and "DROP DATABASE".
      In the worst case this could result in deleting a newly created
      table in a new database that happened to get the same OID as the
      recently-dropped one; but of course that is an extremely
      low-probability scenario.
    - Repair two places where SIGTERM exit of a backend could leave
      corrupted state in shared memory.
    - Fix possible crash due to incorrect plan generated for an x IN
      (SELECT y FROM ...) clause when "x" and "y" have different data
      types; and make sure the behavior is semantically correct when the
      conversion from "y"'s type to "x"'s type is lossy.
    - Fix oversight that prevented the planner from substituting known
      Param values as if they were constants.
    - Fix planner failure when an indexable MIN or MAX aggregate is used
      with DISTINCT or ORDER BY.
    - Fix planner to ensure it never uses a "physical tlist" for a plan
      node that is feeding a Sort node.
    - Avoid unnecessary copying of query strings.
    - Make TransactionIdIsCurrentTransactionId() use binary search
      instead of linear search when checking child-transaction XIDs.
      This fixes some cases in which 8.3.0 was significantly slower than
      earlier releases.
    - Fix conversions between ISO-8859-5 and other encodings to handle
      Cyrillic "Yo" characters (e and E with two dots).
    - Fix several datatype input functions, notably array_in(), that were
      allowing unused bytes in their results to contain uninitialized,
      unpredictable values. This could lead to failures in which two
      apparently identical literal values were not seen as equal, resulting in
      the parser complaining about unmatched ORDER BY and DISTINCT
      expressions.
    - Fix a corner case in regular-expression substring matching
      (substring(string from pattern)).
      The problem occurs when there is a match to the pattern overall but
      the user has specified a parenthesized subexpression and that
      subexpression hasn't got a match. An example is substring('foo'
      from 'foo(bar)?'). This should return NULL, since (bar) isn't
      matched, but it was mistakenly returning the whole-pattern match
      instead (ie, foo).
    - Prevent cancellation of an auto-vacuum that was launched to prevent
      XID wraparound.
    - Improve "ANALYZE"'s handling of in-doubt tuples (those inserted or
      deleted by a not-yet-committed transaction) so that the counts it
      reports to the stats collector are more likely to be correct.
    - Fix initdb to reject a relative path for its --xlogdir (-X) option.
    - Make psql print tab characters as an appropriate number of spaces,
      rather than \x09 as was done in 8.3.0 and 8.3.1.
    - Add ECPGget_PGconn() function to ecpglib. Dropped
      00upstream-ecpg-get-connection.patch, which backported this fix.
    - Fix incorrect result from ecpg's PGTYPEStimestamp_sub() function.
    - Fix handling of continuation line markers in ecpg.
    - Fix possible crashes in "contrib/cube" functions.
    - Fix core dump in "contrib/xml2"'s xpath_table() function when the
      input query returns a NULL value.
  * Build against tcl 8.5.

postgresql-8.3 (8.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release:
    - Repair corner-case bugs in "VACUUM FULL".
    - Fix misbehavior of foreign key checks involving character or bit
      columns.
    - Avoid needless deadlock failures in no-op foreign-key checks.
    - Fix possible core dump when re-planning a prepared query.
    - Fix possible failure when re-planning a query that calls an
      SPI-using function.
    - Fix failure in row-wise comparisons involving columns of different
      datatypes.
    - Fix longstanding "LISTEN"/"NOTIFY" race condition.
    - Disallow "LISTEN" and "UNLISTEN" within a prepared transaction
      This was formerly allowed but trying to do it had various
      unpleasant consequences, notably that the originating backend could
      not exit as long as an "UNLISTEN" remained uncommitted.
    - Disallow dropping a temporary table within a prepared transaction
      This was correctly disallowed by 8.1, but the check was
      inadvertently broken in 8.2 and 8.3.
    - Fix rare crash when an error occurs during a query using a hash
      index.
    - Fix incorrect comparison of tsquery values.
    - Fix incorrect behavior of LIKE with non-ASCII characters in
      single-byte encodings. (Closes: #469180)
    - Disable xmlvalidate. This function should have been removed before 8.3
      release, but was inadvertently left in the source code. It poses a small
      security risk since unprivileged users could use it to read the first
      few characters of any file accessible to the server.
    - Fix memory leaks in certain usages of set-returning functions.
    - Make encode(bytea, 'escape') convert all high-bit-set byte values
      into \"nnn" octal escape sequences.
      This is necessary to avoid encoding problems when the database
      encoding is multi-byte. This change could pose compatibility issues
      for applications that are expecting specific results from encode.
    - Fix input of datetime values for February 29 in years BC.
      The former coding was mistaken about which years were leap years.
    . Fix "unrecognized node type" error in some variants of "ALTER
      OWNER".
    - Avoid tablespace permissions errors in "CREATE TABLE LIKE INCLUDING
      INDEXES".
    - Ensure pg_stat_activity.waiting flag is cleared when a lock wait is
      aborted.
    - Fix ecpg problems with arrays.
    - Fix pg_ctl to correctly extract the postmaster's port number from
      command-line options. Previously, pg_ctl start -w could try to contact
      the postmaster on the wrong port, leading to bogus reports of startup
      failure. (Closes: #358546)
    - Use "-fwrapv" to defend against possible misoptimization in recent

  * Add debian/patches/13-pg_service.conf_directory_doc.patch: Change
    documentation comment in sample pg_service.conf to point to Debian's
    sysconfdir (/etc/postgresql-common) instead of /usr/local/pgsql/etc.
  * Fix dependencies of libecpg-dev.

postgresql-8.3 (8.3~rc1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * First release candidate of PostgreSQL 8.3. This also provides the security
    bug fixes of 8.2.6:
    - Prevent functions in indexes from executing with the privileges of
      the user running "VACUUM", "ANALYZE", etc. "SET ROLE" is now forbidden
      within a SECURITY DEFINER context. [CVE-2007-6600]
    - Suitably crafted regular-expression patterns could cause crashes,
      infinite or near-infinite looping, and/or massive memory
      consumption, all of which pose denial-of-service hazards for
      applications that accept regex search patterns from untrustworthy
      sources. [CVE-2007-4769, CVE-2007-4772, CVE-2007-6067]
    - Require non-superusers who use "/contrib/dblink" to use only
      password authentication, as a security measure.
      The fix that appeared for this in 8.2.5 was incomplete, as it
      plugged the hole for only some "dblink" functions. [CVE-2007-6601,
      CVE-2007-3278]
  * debian/patches/04-psql-passwordprompt.patch: Update for new version.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.3 (no changes necessary).
  * debian/rules:
    - Build with -O1 on sparc and alpha until the miscompilation with -O2 is
      sorted out (http://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha/2007/11/msg00025.html).
    - Have a failed test suite fail the build on all architectures again.
  * Ship pg_config in postgresql-server-dev, and ship a copy in /usr/bin in
    libpq-dev, instead of libpq-dev shipping it in
    /usr/lib/postgresql/<version>/bin. This makes it possible to use a
    libpq-dev from a different major version. (See #455509)
  * debian/control: Mention tablefunc in -contrib description.
    (Closes: #458752)
  * debian/rules: Run make bigcheck instead of check, to run the numeric_big
    test, too.
  * debian/rules: Add target 'contrib-check' for running the tests in contrib.
    Do not call it by default for now, still needs some work.
  * debian/rules: Add target 'contrib-installcheck' for running the tests in
    contrib, using the installed programs in the system.
  * debian/rules: Replace hardcoded '8.3' strings with $(MAJOR_VER) variable.

postgresql-8.3 (8.3~beta3-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Drop libgssapi-dev build dependency, current krb does not
    need it any more. (Closes: #452549)

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Nov 2007 17:26:12 +0100

postgresql-8.3 (8.3~beta3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Third beta release of PostgreSQL 8.3.
  * debian/rules:
    - Ignore test suite failure on alpha for now, since it behaves weird on
      some floating point operations (regression in glibc and gcc-4.2). Bug is
      under investigation. Fixes FTBFS for now. (see #449002)
    - Remove test suite ignoring for mips and mipsel again, seems the buildds
      finally got a fixed kernel.
  * Add debian/patches/12-psql-sensible-editor.patch: Use sensible-editor
    instead of vi as editor fallback in psql if $EDITOR and friends are not
    defined. (Closes: #451553)
  * Enable OSSP UUID support, add build dependency libossp-uuid-dev.
    (Closes: #451336)
  * Install some missing .so libraries.
  * debian/rules: Check that all files in debian/tmp get installed to
    somewhere, and fail the build if not.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Nov 2007 20:18:44 +0100

postgresql-8.3 (8.3~beta2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Second beta release of PostgreSQL 8.3.
  * Remove patches which are upstream now:
    00upstream-encoding-abibreakage.patch, 12-pgpassfile-crash.patch
  * 03-gettext-domains.patch: Adapt to new upstream version.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Oct 2007 12:37:43 -0400

postgresql-8.3 (8.3~beta1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Update -contrib description for new modules.
  * debian/{control,rules}: Enable GSSAPI and LDAP support and add build
    dependencies libgssapi-dev and libldap2-dev.
  * Add debian/patches/00upstream-encoding-abibreakage.patch: Fix libpq ABI
    breakage wrt. ordering of encoding names. Taken from upstream CVS head.
    This requires a catalog bump, thus upgrades from 8.3~beta1-1 will break.
  * debian/postgresql-8.3.postrm:
    - Clean up rotated logs on purge when postgresql-common is already gone.
      (Closes: #447445)
    - Clean up default data dir/log file if 'pgdata'/'log' symbolic links do
      not exist.
    - Clean up environment file.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Sun, 14 Oct 2007 13:30:32 +0200

postgresql-8.3 (8.3~beta1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * First beta release of PostgreSQL 8.3. Branch off the 8.2 packaging.
  * Drop debian/patches/12-m32r-tas.patch: Adopted upstream.
  * Drop debian/patches/04-timezone-symlinks.patch: Upstream now offers
    configure option --with-system-tzdata. Use it in debian/rules.
  * Drop debian/patches/50-contrib-enablemodules.patch: xml2 is now built
    conditionally. Supply --with-lib{xml,xslt} configure options in
    debian/rules.
  * Updated patches for new upstream version.
  * debian/control: Bump postgresql-common dependencies to >= 79 to ensure
    support of version 8.3.
  * debian/control: Do not build the versionless metapackages like
    'postgresql' until 8.3 is released and goes to unstable. Until then, 8.2
    should remain the default.
  * Add debian/patches/04-psql-passwordprompt.patch: Change psql to not prompt
    for a password if PGPASSWORD is given, just as in earlier versions.
    Without that, there is no way to suppress the password input prompt, which
    is bad for scripts.
  * Add debian/patches/12-pgpassfile-crash.patch: Fix crash (free'ing a static
    stack variable) in fe-connect.c.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Tue, 09 Oct 2007 16:28:51 +0200

postgresql-8.2 (8.2.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release:
    - Require non-superusers who use "/contrib/dblink" to use only
      password authentication, as a security measure.
      [CVE-2007-3278, CVE-2007-3280]
    - Fix ALTER DOMAIN ADD CONSTRAINT for cases involving domains over
      domains.
    - Make "CREATE DOMAIN ... DEFAULT NULL" work properly.
    - Fix some planner problems with outer joins, notably poor size
      estimation for t1 LEFT JOIN t2 WHERE t2.col IS NULL.
    - Allow the interval data type to accept input consisting only of
      milliseconds or microseconds.
    - Allow timezone name to appear before the year in timestamp input.
    - Fixes for GIN indexes used by "/contrib/tsearch2".
    - Speed up rtree index insertion.
    - Fix excessive logging of SSL error messages.
    - Fix logging so that log messages are never interleaved when using
      the syslogger process.
    - Fix crash when log_min_error_statement logging runs out of memory.
    - Fix incorrect handling of some foreign-key corner cases.
    - Fix stddev_pop(numeric) and var_pop(numeric).
    - Prevent "REINDEX" and "CLUSTER" from failing due to attempting to
      process temporary tables of other sessions.
    - Restrict "/contrib/pgstattuple" functions to superusers, for
      security reasons.
    - Do not let "/contrib/intarray" try to make its GIN opclass the
      default (this caused problems at dump/restore).
  * Remove debian/patches/00upstream-01-polymorphic-functions.patch: Upstream
    now.

postgresql-8.2 (8.2.4-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Urgency medium since the dpkg bug above is nasty and I want this fixed in
    testing ASAP.
  * debian/postgresql-8.2.postinst: Work around dpkg bug #435938 by manually
    doing the timezone symlink transition. Closes: #430524
  * debian/rules: Make binary-arch idempotent if test suite fails.
    Closes: #431565

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Sat, 04 Aug 2007 14:07:00 +0200

postgresql-8.2 (8.2.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Remove some unnecessary build depends. Closes: #424010
  * debian/postgresql-8.2.install: Actually install the "timezone" symlink,
    not the dereferenced files.
  * Add debian/patches/12-m32r-tas.patch:
    - Support m32r architecture, thanks to Kazuhiro Inaoka for the initial
      patch.
    - Backported from CVS head:
      http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-committers/2007-05/msg00065.php
    - Closes: #419267

postgresql-8.2 (8.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream security/bug fix release:
    - Support explicit placement of the temporary-table schema within
      search_path, and disable searching it for functions and operators.
      This is needed to allow a security-definer function to set a truly
      secure value of search_path. Without it, an unprivileged SQL user
      can use temporary objects to execute code with the privileges of
      the security-definer function (CVE-2007-2138). See "CREATE
      FUNCTION" for more information.
    - Fix to_char() so it properly upper/lower cases localized day or
      month names.
    - "/contrib/tsearch2" crash fixes.
    - Require "COMMIT PREPARED" to be executed in the same database as
      the transaction was prepared in.
    - New traditional (Taiwan) Chinese FAQ.
    - Prevent the statistics collector from writing to disk too
      frequently.
    - Fix potential-data-corruption bug in how "VACUUM FULL" handles
      "UPDATE" chains.
    - Fix bug in domains that use array types.
    - Fix "pg_dump" so it can dump a serial column's sequence using "-t"
      when not also dumping the owning table.
    - Planner fixes, including improving outer join and bitmap scan
      selection logic.
    - Fix possible wrong answers or crash when a PL/pgSQL function tries
      to RETURN from within an EXCEPTION block.
    - Fix PANIC during enlargement of a hash index.
  * debian/patches/04-timezone-symlinks.patch: Adapt to slightly changed
    Makefile of 8.2.4.
  * Remove debian/patches/12-vacuum-cycle-hang.patch: Fixed upstream.
  * debian/postgresql-8.2.postrm: Fix bashism.

postgresql-8.2 (8.2.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Do not let failed test suite fail the build on mips and

  * debian/control: Add empty postgresql{,-client,-contrib,-doc} packages
    which always point to the latest available version.

postgresql-8.2 (8.2.3-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Do not FTBFS on failed test suite on sparc. sparc throws a
    'floating point exception' instead of a 'division by zero' error, which is
    fine, but differs from expected string output. Closes: #417160

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Wed,  4 Apr 2007 12:09:37 +0200

postgresql-8.2 (8.2.3-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Add Perl dependency to p-8.2-plperl, to ensure that
    creating plperl functions works (as opposed to plperlu, which only needs
    libperl). (see bug #412135)
  * debian/control: Do not mention nor suggest 'pgdocs' any more in p-doc's
    description since pgdocs is only available for 7.4. (see bug #405097)
  * debian/patches/04-timezone-symlinks.patch:
    - Use the timezone database from the system tzdata instead of shipping our
      own. Towards a single authoritative time zone database in Debian and
      Ubuntu... :) (LP: #41159)
    - Drop previous hardlink-to-symlink patch to zic, since that is irrelevant
      now.
    - debian/control: Add tzdata dependency.
  * Add debian/patches/12-vacuum-cycle-hang.patch: Properly release our
    semaphore lock before erroring out wit elog() to prevent deadlocks on
    vacuum errors. Thanks to Heikki Linnakangas!
  * debian/rules: Have a test suite failure fail the build again. Let's ignore
    the old kernels on the Debian mips[el] buildds for now.

postgresql-8.2 (8.2.3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release to fix regressions in 8.2.2:
    - Remove overly-restrictive check for type length in constraints and
      functional indexes.
    - Fix optimization so MIN/MAX in subqueries can again use indexes.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Thu,  8 Feb 2007 17:13:08 +0100

postgresql-8.2 (8.2.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream security and bug fix release:
    - Fix security vulnerabilities that allowed connected users to
      read backend memory.
      The vulnerabilities involve suppressing the normal check that a SQL
      function returns the data type it's declared to, and changing the
      data type of a table column (CVE-2007-0555, CVE-2007-0556). These
      errors can easily be exploited to cause a backend crash, and in
      principle might be used to read database content that the user
      should not be able to access.
    - Fix not-so-rare-anymore bug wherein btree index page splits could
      fail due to choosing an infeasible split point.
    - Properly handle to_char('CC') for years ending in 00.
      Year 2000 is in the twentieth century, not the twenty-first.
    - "/contrib/tsearch2" localization improvements.
    - Fix incorrect permission check in information_schema.key_column_usage
      view.
      The symptom is "relation with OID nnnnn does not exist" errors. To
      get this fix without using "initdb", use "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW"
      to install the corrected definition found in
      "share/information_schema.sql". Note you will need to do this in
      each database.
    - Improve "VACUUM" performance for databases with many tables.
    - Fix for rare Assert() crash triggered by UNION.
    - Fix potentially incorrect results from index searches using ROW
      inequality conditions.
    - Tighten security of multi-byte character processing for UTF8
      sequences over three bytes long.
    - Fix possible crashes when an already-in-use PL/pgSQL function is
      updated.
    - Improve PL/pgSQL handling of domain types.
    - Fix possible errors in processing PL/pgSQL exception blocks.
  * debian/control: postgresql-client-8.2 provides postgresql-client. This
    avoids breaking all the reverse dependencies to p-c when the transitional
    package gets removed. Closes: #400648

postgresql-8.2 (8.2.1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/libpq-dev.install: Install missing pg_trace.h.
  * debian/control: Remove -contrib's libpg-perl recommendation, nothing in
    -contrib uses it any more. Thanks to Peter Eisentraut for spotting this.
    Closes: #408070
  * debian/control: Update -contrib package description for 8.2. 
    Closes: #408072

postgresql-8.2 (8.2.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream bugfix release:
    - Fix crash with SELECT ... LIMIT ALL (also LIMIT NULL).
    - "Several /contrib/tsearch2" fixes (Teodor)
    - Fix planner mistakes for outer join queries.
    - Fix several problems in queries involving sub-SELECTs.
    - Fix potential crash in SPI during subtransaction abort.
      This affects all PL functions since they all use SPI.
    - Improve build speed of PDF documentation.
    - Re-add JST (Japan) timezone abbreviation.
    - Improve optimization decisions related to index scans.
    - Have psql print multi-byte combining characters as before, rather
      than output as \u.
    - Improve index usage of regular expressions that use parentheses.
      This improves psql \d performance also.
    - Make pg_dumpall assume that databases have public CONNECT
      privilege, when dumping from a pre-8.2 server.
      This preserves the previous behavior that anyone can connect to a
      database if allowed by "pg_hba.conf".

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Aug 2006 12:31:37 +0200

postgresql-8.1 (8.1.4-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Install init script at priority 19, since Apache and web
    applications usually reside on priority 20, but often require a running
    database. This follows a recent change in the MySQL package, thanks to
    Christian Hammers for pointing this out. Closes: #379276
  * Add debian/patches/12-pg_restore-ignore-failing-tables.patch:
    - pg_restore: Add option -X no-data-for-failed-tables to ignore TABLE DATA
      objects if the corresponding TABLE could not be created. Necessary for

postgresql-8.1 (8.1.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Use -fPIC instead of -fpic to avoid FTBFS on sparc and m68k
    (and maybe avoid the ICE on arm).
  * debian/postgresql-8.1.init: Add LSB magic comment header (provide both
    postgresql-8.1 and a generic postgresql service). Closes: #377882

postgresql-8.1 (8.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream security and bug fix release:
    - The server now rejects invalidly-encoded multibyte characters in all
      cases to defend against SQL-injection attacks. [CVE-2006-2313]
    - Reject unsafe uses of \' in string literals (for client encodings that
      allow SQL injection with this, like SJIS, BIG5, GBK, GB18030, or UHC). A
      new configuration parameter backslash_quote is available to adjust this
      behavior when needed. [CVE-2006-2314]
    - Modify libpq's string-escaping routines to be aware of encoding
      considerations and standard_conforming_strings
      This fixes libpq-using applications for the security issues
      described in CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314, and also
      future-proofs them against the planned changeover to SQL-standard
      string literal syntax. Applications that use multiple PostgreSQL
      connections concurrently should migrate to PQescapeStringConn() and
      PQescapeByteaConn() to ensure that escaping is done correctly for
      the settings in use in each database connection. Applications that
      do string escaping "by hand" should be modified to rely on library
      routines instead.
    - Various bug fixes, see upstream changelog for details.
  * Remove debian/patches/12-krb5-multiusers.patch: Fixed upstream.
  * debian/postgresql-8.1.init: Add a comment to point out that environment
    variables need to be set in the 'environment' file, not in the init
    script.
  * debian/postgresql-8.1.init, debian/postgresql-8.1.postinst: Do not fail if
    init.d-functions/maintscripts-functions are not present, which happens if
    postgresql-{8.1,common} are removed, but not purged. Closes: #362488
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.2.

postgresql-8.1 (8.1.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - Put --as-needed into LDFLAGS instead of CFLAGS to avoid warnings when
      building extension modules. Closes: #360759
    - Fix a bashism.
  * debian/control: Suggest oidentd | ident-server (oidentd prefered since it
    works with IPv6). Closes: #359193
  * libecpg-dev: Move manpage to /usr/share/man/man1 where it belongs to.
    Closes: #360817
  * debian/rules: Ship the tutorial's Makefile and ship the SQL *.source files
    (not the generated *.sql files) to get the correct path to the built
    libraries. Closes: #360469
  * Add debian/patches/13-tutorial-README.patch: Remove confusing note about
    make and point out that p-server-dev-8.1 is required for building the
    tutorial.
  * debian/postgresql-contrib-8.1.install, 50-contrib-oracle-enable.patch:
    Move Ora2Pg.pm to /usr/share/postgresql/8.1 and adapt the library search
    path in ora2pg.pl accordingly. Closes: #360818

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Apr 2006 22:43:11 +0200

postgresql-8.1 (8.1.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/postgresql-8.1.init: Use shell 'sh -e' instead of bash.
  * debian/postgresql-contrib-8.1.install: Ship ora2pg.pl and Ora2Pg.pm.
  * debian/control: Updated contrib package description. Closes: #355172
  * debian/rules: Don't special-case HPPA for --enable-thread-safety-force;
    the current kernel seems to cope with threads quite well, so that the
    configure check does not hang any more. Closes: #315440
  * debian/control: Build server packages on mips and mipsel again, even if
    they do not work. No need to block testing migration forever (the
    ftp-masters seem reluctant to remove the mips binaries, see #344487), and
    the bug is in binutils, not PostgreSQL itself (see #357603).

postgresql-8.1 (8.1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Re-enable 'do not run as root' check from upstream:
    - Move debian/patches/08-disable-root-check.patch to
      debian/disable-root-check.patch.
    - debian/rules: Move test suite to binary/predeb and apply
      disable-root-check.patch manually right before calling the test suite.
      Unapply debian/disable-root-check.patch after executing the
      test suite to not break subsequent package builds.
    - With this, the test suite can happily run as (fake)root during package
      build without disabling the check in the actual packages.
  * postgresql-doc-8.1: Ship tutorial C and SQL files.
    (https://launchpad.net/bugs/30233)
  * debian/control, postgresql-client-8.1: Depend on postgresql-client-common
    instead of postgresql-common.

    - See upstream changelog for detailled changes.
  * Remove debian/patches/80-cvs-pg_restore-COPY.patch: Upstream now.
  * debian/rules: Use --as-needed linker option to avoid excessive
    library dependencies.
  * debian/control: Remove unnecessary dependencies from PL/Python and PL/Tcl
    packages.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Feb 2006 17:46:31 +0100

postgresql-8.1 (8.1.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/09-relax-sslkey-permscheck.patch: Do not check for any
    particular group if the SSL key is group readable, to allow sharing a
    common SSL certificate with other server processes.
  * debian/control: Add ${shlibs:Depends} to packages which need it.
    Closes: #348066
  * debian/control, libecpg5: Remove obsolete Provides/Conflicts to ecpg.
  * Add debian/patches/80-cvs-pg_restore-COPY.patch:
    - Fix pg_restore to properly discard COPY data when trying to continue
      after an error in a COPY statement.  Formerly it thought the COPY data
      was SQL commands, and got quite confused.
    - Patch from Stephen Frost, taken from upstream CVS.
  * Add debian/patches/12-krb5-multiusers.patch:
    - Fix krb5 credential handling in libpq for multiple connections with
      different users: Don't keep credentials in global variables, but pass
      them around in a new krb5_info struct.
    - Patch from Stephen Frost, proposed to be adopted upstream.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Feb 2006 21:07:31 +0100

postgresql-8.1 (8.1.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream bugfix release:
    - Fix bug introduced in 8.0 that could allow ReadBuffer to return an
      already-used page as new, potentially causing loss of recently-committed
      data.
    - Fix for protocol-level Describe messages issued outside a
      transaction or in a failed transaction.
    - Fix character string comparison for locales that consider different
      character combinations as equal, such as Hungarian.
      This might require "REINDEX" to fix existing indexes on textual
      columns.
    - Set locale environment variables during postmaster startup to
      ensure that plperl won't change the locale later. This fixes a problem
      that occurred if the postmaster was started
      with environment variables specifying a different locale than what
      initdb had been told. Under these conditions, any use of plperl was
      likely to lead to corrupt indexes. You may need "REINDEX" to fix
      existing indexes on textual columns if this has happened to you.
      (postgresql-common checks and aborts on this condition.)
    - Allow more flexible relocation of installation directories.
      Previous releases supported relocation only if all installation
      directory paths were the same except for the last component.
      This makes the test suite work with Debian's directory structure, so
      that the horology test can find the timezones again and pass.
    - Prevent crashes caused by the use of ISO-8859-5 and ISO-8859-9
      encodings.
    - Fix longstanding bug in strpos() and regular expression handling in
      certain rarely used Asian multi-byte character sets.
    - Fix bug where COPY CSV mode considered any \. to terminate the copy
      data. The new code requires \. to appear alone on a line, as per
      documentation.
    - Make COPY CSV mode quote a literal data value of \. to ensure it
      cannot be interpreted as the end-of-data marker.
    - Various fixes for functions returning RECORDs.
    - Fix processing of "postgresql.conf" so a final line with no newline
      is processed properly.
    - Fix bug in "/contrib/pgcrypto" gen_salt, which caused it not to use
      all available salt space for MD5 and XDES algorithms.  Salts for
      Blowfish and standard DES are unaffected.
    - Fix autovacuum crash when processing expression indexes.
    - Fix "/contrib/dblink" to throw an error, rather than crashing, when
      the number of columns specified is different from what's actually
      returned by the query.
  * Remove debian/patches/12-readline-prompt-ignore.patch: Adopted upstream.
  * Bump postgresql-common dependencies to >= 39. This will ensure more
    robust upgrades and other bug fixes.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Jan 2006 18:34:31 +0100

postgresql-8.1 (8.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not build postgresql-8.1, p-contrib-8.1, and the PL/ packages on mips
    and mipsel, since the postmaster just SIGBUSes on these architectures and
    nobody seems to be able to fix that.
  * Add debian/patches/12-readline-prompt-ignore.patch: Do not prepend a
    '\001' before the 'prompt ignore begin/end' readline commands; this is a
    bash quirk, not a readline feature. Thanks to Aaron Schrab.

    - 52-contrib-dbf2pg-errorcheck.patch
    - 53-contrib-dbf2pg-textfield
  * debian/patches/09-relax-sslkey-permscheck.patch: Use effective rather than
    real group id for checking the private SSL certificate permissions. It
    does not make any practical difference, but is more consistent.

    /usr/lib/postgresql/8.0/bin to make it print correct paths, and install a
    symlink into /usr/bin instead. Closes: #305200
  * debian/rules: Change include dir configure option to
    /usr/include/postgresql/8.0, so that different versions of
    postgresql-server-dev-<version> do not conflict with each other. Since
    applications using the libpq-dev are supposed to use pg_config, this
    should not break them either.
