postgresql-9.2 (9.2~beta2-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Christoph Berg ]
  * Some cosmetic changes to control and rules file.
  * Remove the beta1 suffix from 9.2~beta1 in symbols files as this was the
    first version.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * debian/source/options: Ignore .bzr-builddeb/default.conf so bzr checkouts
    can be built using dpkg-buildpackage.
  * postgresql-9.2.preinst: Remove obsolete code for transition from
    per-version init script which was never shipped in postgresql-9.2. Also,
    remove duplicate #DEBHELPER# token.

  [ Peter Eisentraut ]
  * Move pg_basebackup man page to -client-9.2, where the program is.
