  * New upstream version.
    + Fix infinite loops and buffer-overrun problems in regular expressions.
      Very large character ranges in bracket expressions could cause infinite
      loops in some cases, and memory overwrites in other cases.

postgresql-9.4 (9.4.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.

    + Guard against stack overflows in json parsing (Oskari Saarenmaa)

      If an application constructs PostgreSQL json or jsonb values from
      arbitrary user input, the application's users can reliably crash the
      PostgreSQL server, causing momentary denial of service.  (CVE-2015-5289)

    + Fix contrib/pgcrypto to detect and report too-short crypt() salts
      (Josh Kupershmidt)

      Certain invalid salt arguments crashed the server or disclosed a few
      bytes of server memory.  We have not ruled out the viability of attacks
      that arrange for presence of confidential information in the disclosed
      bytes, but they seem unlikely.  (CVE-2015-5288)

  * debian/rules: Call dh without --parallel, it's not supported upstream.

    Avoid failures while fsync'ing data directory during crash restart
    (Abhijit Menon-Sen, Tom Lane; Closes: #786874)

postgresql-9.4 (9.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.

    + Avoid possible crash when client disconnects just before the
      authentication timeout expires (Benkocs Norbert Attila)

      If the timeout interrupt fired partway through the session shutdown
      sequence, SSL-related state would be freed twice, typically causing a
      crash and hence denial of service to other sessions.  Experimentation
      shows that an unauthenticated remote attacker could trigger the bug
      somewhat consistently, hence treat as security issue. (CVE-2015-3165)

    + Improve detection of system-call failures (Noah Misch)

      Our replacement implementation of snprintf() failed to check for errors
      reported by the underlying system library calls; the main case that
      might be missed is out-of-memory situations. In the worst case this
      might lead to information exposure, due to our code assuming that a
      buffer had been overwritten when it hadn't been. Also, there were a few
      places in which security-relevant calls of other system library
      functions did not check for failure.

      It remains possible that some calls of the *printf() family of functions
      are vulnerable to information disclosure if an out-of-memory error
      occurs at just the wrong time.  We judge the risk to not be large, but
      will continue analysis in this area. (CVE-2015-3166)

    + In contrib/pgcrypto, uniformly report decryption failures as Wrong key
      or corrupt data (Noah Misch)

      Previously, some cases of decryption with an incorrect key could report
      other error message texts.  It has been shown that such variance in
      error reports can aid attackers in recovering keys from other systems.
      While it's unknown whether pgcrypto's specific behaviors are likewise
      exploitable, it seems better to avoid the risk by using a
      one-size-fits-all message. (CVE-2015-3167)

    + Protect against wraparound of multixact member IDs
      (√Ålvaro Herrera, Robert Haas, Thomas Munro)

      Under certain usage patterns, the existing defenses against this might
      be insufficient, allowing pg_multixact/members files to be removed too
      early, resulting in data loss.
      The fix for this includes modifying the server to fail transactions that
      would result in overwriting old multixact member ID data, and improving
      autovacuum to ensure it will act proactively to prevent multixact member
      ID wraparound, as it does for transaction ID wraparound.

    + pg_dump -Fd -Z compression level fixed. (Closes: #781361)

  * Make postgresql-9.4 Recommends: postgresql-contrib-9.4.
  * Enable TAP tests.
  * Repository moved to git, update Vcs headers.

postgresql-9.4 (9.4~beta2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta version.
    + Secure Unix-domain sockets of temporary postmasters started during make
      check (Noah Misch)

      Any local user able to access the socket file could connect as the
      server's bootstrap superuser, then proceed to execute arbitrary code as
      the operating-system user running the test, as we previously noted in
      CVE-2014-0067. This change defends against that risk by placing the
      server's socket in a temporary, mode 0700 subdirectory of /tmp.

  * postgresql-9.4.preinst: Fail upgrade when upgrading from beta1, the
    catalog version changed. People should dump/remove their old clusters
    first.
  * Use util-linux' uuid lib as backend for the uuid-ossp extension
    (--with-uuid=e2fs).
  * Enable sepgsql (--with-selinux). On systems with libselinux1-dev < 2.1.10,
    this is automatically disabled.
  * Revert multiarch for libpq-dev and libecpg-dev. (Closes: #750111, #750112)
  * Remove our pg_regress patches to support --host=/path. Implemented
    upstream as fix for CVE-2014-0067.
  * debian/copyright: Say that there are various copyright holders for the
    contrib modules. (Hello Lintian!)
  * Update Vcs URLs.
