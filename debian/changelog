postgresql-9.2 (9.2.2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Add 03-python-includedirs.patch: Detect both python3.3 include locations.
    Thanks Dmitrijs Ledkovs!
  * debian/rules: Only build the error codes and the plpython subtree for the
    "python3" flavor, to cut down build time.

  [ Christoph Berg ]
  * debian/tests: Moved autopkgtest integration here from postgresql-common.

postgresql-9.2 (9.2.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream bug fix release. See HISTORY/changelog.gz details.
  * debian/control, debian/rules: Build against krb5-multidev, to allow use
    while heimdal-dev is installed. Thanks Jelmer Vernooij! (Closes: #664881)
  * debian/control: Force p-client to use libpq5 from at least our upstream
    version, as -client tends to use private ABI and behaviour that is not
    covered by symbols files.

postgresql-9.2 (9.2.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream bug fix release:
    - Fix persistence marking of shared buffers during WAL replay.
      This mistake can result in buffers not being written out during
      checkpoints, resulting in data corruption if the server later
      crashes without ever having written those buffers. Corruption can
      occur on any server following crash recovery, but it is
      significantly more likely to occur on standby slave servers since
      those perform much more WAL replay. There is a low probability of
      corruption of btree and GIN indexes. There is a much higher
      probability of corruption of table "visibility maps", which might
      lead to wrong answers from index-only scans. Table data proper
      cannot be corrupted by this bug.
      While no index corruption due to this bug is known to have occurred
      in the field, as a precautionary measure it is recommended that
      production installations "REINDEX" all btree and GIN indexes at a
      convenient time after upgrading to 9.2.1.
      Also, it is recommended to perform a "VACUUM" of all tables while
      having vacuum_freeze_table_age set to zero. This will fix any
      incorrect visibility map data. vacuum_cost_delay can be adjusted to
      reduce the performance impact of vacuuming, while causing it to
      take longer to finish.
    - See HISTORY/changelog.gz for other bug fixes.
  * debian/rules: Compress all binaries with xz. Thanks Cyril Brulebois!

  * Bump postgresql-common dependency to >= 135~, we need the fixed manpages
    alternatives handling. Remove the redundant dependency of the -contrib
    package on postgresql-common.

postgresql-9.2 (9.2.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version: Official 9.2 release.
  * debian/rules: Re-enable hardening functions when hardening-wrapper is not
    installed. Use "hardening=all", but disable "pie" (as that's not
    compatible with -fPIC) and add -pie to CFLAGS explicitly. Also drop the
    explicit "-Wl,-z,now" linker option, as this is now implied with "all".

    first version.
  * Remove beta2 symbols from libpq5: PQgetRowProcessor@Base,
    PQsetRowProcessor@Base, PQskipResult@Base.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * debian/source/options: Ignore .bzr-builddeb/default.conf so bzr checkouts
    can be built using dpkg-buildpackage.
  * postgresql-9.2.preinst: Remove obsolete code for transition from
    per-version init script which was never shipped in postgresql-9.2. Also,

    for spotting this.
  * Move pg_receivexlog into -client-9.2. It can be used without the server
    being installed.
  * debian/control: Move bzr branches to alioth, so that other members of
    pkg-postgresql can commit. Update Vcs-* tags.
  * debian/control: Set Maintainer: to pkg-postgresql group, and move myself
    to Uploaders:.
