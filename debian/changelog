postgresql-9.4 (9.4~beta1-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Update watch file for 9.4.
  * Enable multiarch support in libpq and friends. (Closes: #706849)
    Support is automatically disabled when the distribution does not support
    it.
  * Stop providing postgresql-dbg in postgresql-9.4-dbg. Its only purpose was
    to conflict with other postgresql-*-dbg packages, and that's no longer
    needed with build-id debug symbols.
  * Skip -pie on 32bit archs for performance and stability reasons.
    Closes: #749686; details at
    http://www.postgresql.org/message-id/20140519115318.GB7296@msgid.df7cb.de
  * Update contrib copyright statements, and move them to a separate file.
    Thanks to Thorsten Alteholz for reviewing the package.
