postgresql-9.6 (9.6~beta1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New major upstream version 9.6; packaging based on postgresql-9.5.

    Major enhancements in PostgreSQL 9.6 include:
    + Parallel sequential scans, joins and aggregates
    + Elimination of repetitive scanning of old data by autovacuum
    + Synchronous replication now allows multiple standby servers for
      increased reliability
    + Full-text search for phrases
    + Support for remote joins, sorts, and updates in postgres_fdw
    + Substantial performance improvements, especially in the area of
      improving scalability on many-CPU servers

  * Record PostgreSQL catalog version number in .deb control file and a file
    inside the .deb. Hook into preinst/postinst logic in postgresql-common 171
    to handle catalog version bumps.
