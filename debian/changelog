  * New upstream version.

    + Avoid possible crash when client disconnects just before the
      authentication timeout expires (Benkocs Norbert Attila)

      If the timeout interrupt fired partway through the session shutdown
      sequence, SSL-related state would be freed twice, typically causing a
      crash and hence denial of service to other sessions.  Experimentation
      shows that an unauthenticated remote attacker could trigger the bug
      somewhat consistently, hence treat as security issue. (CVE-2015-3165)

    + Improve detection of system-call failures (Noah Misch)

      Our replacement implementation of snprintf() failed to check for errors
      reported by the underlying system library calls; the main case that
      might be missed is out-of-memory situations. In the worst case this
      might lead to information exposure, due to our code assuming that a
      buffer had been overwritten when it hadn't been. Also, there were a few
      places in which security-relevant calls of other system library
      functions did not check for failure.

      It remains possible that some calls of the *printf() family of functions
      are vulnerable to information disclosure if an out-of-memory error
      occurs at just the wrong time.  We judge the risk to not be large, but
      will continue analysis in this area. (CVE-2015-3166)

    + In contrib/pgcrypto, uniformly report decryption failures as Wrong key
      or corrupt data (Noah Misch)

      Previously, some cases of decryption with an incorrect key could report
      other error message texts.  It has been shown that such variance in
      error reports can aid attackers in recovering keys from other systems.
      While it's unknown whether pgcrypto's specific behaviors are likewise
      exploitable, it seems better to avoid the risk by using a
      one-size-fits-all message. (CVE-2015-3167)

    + Protect against wraparound of multixact member IDs
      (Álvaro Herrera, Robert Haas, Thomas Munro)

      Under certain usage patterns, the existing defenses against this might
      be insufficient, allowing pg_multixact/members files to be removed too
      early, resulting in data loss.
      The fix for this includes modifying the server to fail transactions that
      would result in overwriting old multixact member ID data, and improving
      autovacuum to ensure it will act proactively to prevent multixact member
      ID wraparound, as it does for transaction ID wraparound.

  * New upstream release.
    + Secure Unix-domain sockets of temporary postmasters started during make
      check (Noah Misch)

      Any local user able to access the socket file could connect as the
      server's bootstrap superuser, then proceed to execute arbitrary code as
      the operating-system user running the test, as we previously noted in
      CVE-2014-0067. This change defends against that risk by placing the
      server's socket in a temporary, mode 0700 subdirectory of /tmp.

postgresql-9.3 (9.3.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream bugfix release. Most notable change:

    Fix WAL replay of locking an already-updated tuple (Andres Freund,
    Álvaro Herrera)

    This error caused updated rows to not be found by index scans, resulting
    in inconsistent query results depending on whether an index scan was used.
    Subsequent processing could result in constraint violations, since the
    previously updated row would not be found by later index searches, thus
    possibly allowing conflicting rows to be inserted. Since this error is in
    WAL replay, it would only manifest during crash recovery or on standby
    servers. The improperly-replayed case most commonly arises when a table
    row that is referenced by a foreign-key constraint is updated concurrently
    with creation of a referencing row.

  * Compile with -fno-omit-frame-pointer on amd64 to facilitate hierarchical
    profile generation. (Closes: #730134)

  [ Christoph Berg ]
  * New upstream security/bugfix release.

    + Shore up GRANT ... WITH ADMIN OPTION restrictions (Noah Misch)

      Granting a role without ADMIN OPTION is supposed to prevent the grantee
      from adding or removing members from the granted role, but this
      restriction was easily bypassed by doing SET ROLE first. The security
      impact is mostly that a role member can revoke the access of others,
      contrary to the wishes of his grantor. Unapproved role member additions
      are a lesser concern, since an uncooperative role member could provide
      most of his rights to others anyway by creating views or SECURITY
      DEFINER functions. (CVE-2014-0060)

    + Prevent privilege escalation via manual calls to PL validator functions
      (Andres Freund)

      The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly
      during CREATE FUNCTION, but they are also normal SQL functions that a
      user can call explicitly. Calling a validator on a function actually
      written in some other language was not checked for and could be
      exploited for privilege-escalation purposes. The fix involves adding a
      call to a privilege-checking function in each validator function.
      Non-core procedural languages will also need to make this change to
      their own validator functions, if any. (CVE-2014-0061)

    + Avoid multiple name lookups during table and index DDL (Robert Haas,
      Andres Freund)

      If the name lookups come to different conclusions due to concurrent
      activity, we might perform some parts of the DDL on a different table
      than other parts. At least in the case of CREATE INDEX, this can be used
      to cause the permissions checks to be performed against a different
      table than the index creation, allowing for a privilege escalation
      attack. (CVE-2014-0062)

    + Prevent buffer overrun with long datetime strings (Noah Misch)

      The MAXDATELEN constant was too small for the longest possible value of
      type interval, allowing a buffer overrun in interval_out(). Although the
      datetime input functions were more careful about avoiding buffer
      overrun, the limit was short enough to cause them to reject some valid
      inputs, such as input containing a very long timezone name. The ecpg
      library contained these vulnerabilities along with some of its own.
      (CVE-2014-0063)

    + Prevent buffer overrun due to integer overflow in size calculations
      (Noah Misch, Heikki Linnakangas)

      Several functions, mostly type input functions, calculated an allocation
      size without checking for overflow. If overflow did occur, a too-small
      buffer would be allocated and then written past. (CVE-2014-0064)

    + Prevent overruns of fixed-size buffers (Peter Eisentraut, Jozef Mlich)

      Use strlcpy() and related functions to provide a clear guarantee that
      fixed-size buffers are not overrun. Unlike the preceding items, it is
      unclear whether these cases really represent live issues, since in most
      cases there appear to be previous constraints on the size of the input
      string. Nonetheless it seems prudent to silence all Coverity warnings of
      this type. (CVE-2014-0065)

    + Avoid crashing if crypt() returns NULL (Honza Horak, Bruce Momjian)

      There are relatively few scenarios in which crypt() could return NULL,
      but contrib/chkpass would crash if it did. One practical case in which
      this could be an issue is if libc is configured to refuse to execute
      unapproved hashing algorithms (e.g., "FIPS mode"). (CVE-2014-0066)

    + Document risks of make check in the regression testing instructions
      (Noah Misch, Tom Lane)

      Since the temporary server started by make check uses "trust"
      authentication, another user on the same machine could connect to it as
      database superuser, and then potentially exploit the privileges of the
      operating-system user who started the tests. A future release will
      probably incorporate changes in the testing procedure to prevent this
      risk, but some public discussion is needed first. So for the moment,
      just warn people against using make check when there are untrusted users
      on the same machine. (CVE-2014-0067)

    + Rework tuple freezing protocol (Álvaro Herrera, Andres Freund)

      The logic for tuple freezing was unable to handle some cases involving
      freezing of multixact IDs, with the practical effect that shared
      row-level locks might be forgotten once old enough.

      Fixing this required changing the WAL record format for tuple freezing.
      While this is no issue for standalone servers, when using replication it
      means that standby servers must be upgraded to 9.3.3 or later before
      their masters are. An older standby will be unable to interpret freeze
      records generated by a newer master, and will fail with a PANIC message.
      (In such a case, upgrading the standby should be sufficient to let it
      resume execution.)

    + Fix "VACUUM"'s tests to see whether it can update relfrozenxid
      (Andres Freund)

      In some cases "VACUUM" (either manual or autovacuum) could
      incorrectly advance a table's relfrozenxid value, allowing tuples
      to escape freezing, causing those rows to become invisible once
      2^31 transactions have elapsed. The probability of data loss is
      fairly low since multiple incorrect advancements would need to
      happen before actual loss occurs, but it's not zero. In 9.2.0 and
      later, the probability of loss is higher, and it's also possible to
      get "could not access status of transaction" errors as a
      consequence of this bug. Users upgrading from releases 9.0.4 or
      8.4.8 or earlier are not affected, but all later versions contain
      the bug.
      The issue can be ameliorated by, after upgrading, vacuuming all
      tables in all databases while having vacuum_freeze_table_age set to
      zero. This will fix any latent corruption but will not be able to
      fix all pre-existing data errors. However, an installation can be
      presumed safe after performing this vacuuming if it has executed
      fewer than 2^31 update transactions in its lifetime (check this
      with SELECT txid_current() < 2^31).

    + Fix multiple bugs in MultiXactId freezing (Andres Freund, Alvaro
      Herrera)

      These bugs could lead to "could not access status of transaction"
      errors, or to duplicate or vanishing rows. Users upgrading from
      releases prior to 9.3.0 are not affected.
      The issue can be ameliorated by, after upgrading, vacuuming all
      tables in all databases while having vacuum_freeze_table_age set to
      zero. This will fix latent corruption but will not be able to fix
      all pre-existing data errors.
      As a separate issue, these bugs can also cause standby servers to
      get out of sync with the primary, thus exhibiting data errors that
      are not in the primary. Therefore, it's recommended that 9.3.0 and
      9.3.1 standby servers be re-cloned from the primary (e.g., with a
      new base backup) after upgrading.

    + Fix initialization of "pg_clog" and "pg_subtrans" during hot
      standby startup (Andres Freund, Heikki Linnakangas)

      This bug can cause data loss on standby servers at the moment they
      start to accept hot-standby queries, by marking committed
      transactions as uncommitted. The likelihood of such corruption is
      small unless, at the time of standby startup, the primary server
      has executed many updating transactions since its last checkpoint.
      Symptoms include missing rows, rows that should have been deleted
      being still visible, and obsolete versions of updated rows being
      still visible alongside their newer versions.
      This bug was introduced in versions 9.3.0, 9.2.5, 9.1.10, and
      9.0.14. Standby servers that have only been running earlier
      releases are not at risk. It's recommended that standby servers
      that have ever run any of the buggy releases be re-cloned from the
      primary (e.g., with a new base backup) after upgrading.
