postgresql-9.2 (9.2~beta2-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Peter Eisentraut ]
  * debian/copyright: Update, fix, and simplify.
  * Add debian/source/options: Ignore test suite .sql files, to fix building
    twice in a row.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Second 9.2 beta release.
  * Move pg_basebackup *.mo files to -client-9.2. Thanks to Peter Eisentraut
    for spotting this.
  * Move pg_receivexlog into -client-9.2. It can be used without the server
    being installed.
  * debian/control: Move bzr branches to alioth, so that other members of
    pkg-postgresql can commit. Update Vcs-* tags.
