    + Disable abbreviated keys for string sorting in non-C locales
      (Robert Haas)

      PostgreSQL 9.5 introduced logic for speeding up comparisons of string
      data types by using the standard C library function strxfrm() as a
      substitute for strcoll().  It now emerges that most versions of glibc
      (Linux's implementation of the C library) have buggy implementations of
      strxfrm() that, in some locales, can produce string comparison results
      that do not match strcoll().  Until this problem can be better
      characterized, disable the optimization in all non-C locales.  (C locale
      is safe since it uses neither strcoll() nor strxfrm().)

      Unfortunately, this problem affects not only sorting but also entry
      ordering in B-tree indexes, which means that B-tree indexes on text,
      varchar, or char columns may now be corrupt if they sort according to an
      affected locale and were built or modified under PostgreSQL 9.5.0 or
      9.5.1. Users should REINDEX indexes that might be affected.

      It is not possible at this time to give an exhaustive list of
      known-affected locales.  C locale is known safe, and there is no
      evidence of trouble in English-based locales such as en_US, but some
      other popular locales such as de_DE are affected in most glibc versions.

    + Maintain row-security status properly in cached plans (Stephen Frost)

      In a session that performs queries as more than one role, the plan cache
      might incorrectly re-use a plan that was generated for another role ID,
      thus possibly applying the wrong set of policies when row-level security
      (RLS) is in use. (CVE-2016-2193)

    + Add must-be-superuser checks to some new contrib/pageinspect functions
      (Andreas Seltenreich)

      Most functions in the pageinspect extension that inspect bytea values
      disallow calls by non-superusers, but brin_page_type() and
      brin_metapage_info() failed to do so.  Passing contrived bytea values to
      them might crash the server or disclose a few bytes of server memory.
      Add the missing permissions checks to prevent misuse. (CVE-2016-3065)

  * 02-relax-sslkey-permscheck.patch: Replace with what went upstream in 9.6.
  * Stop suggesting the use of identd.
  * Modernize server package description.
  * Recommend sysstat.
