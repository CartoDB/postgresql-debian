postgresql-9.1 (9.1~beta1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * First 9.1 beta release. Packaging based on 9.1 branch.
  * debian/rules: Run the test suite under the C locale, otherwise the
    "collate" test is prone to fail.
  * debian/control: Do not build the versionless metapackages for now, as long
    as 9.0 is still the default.
